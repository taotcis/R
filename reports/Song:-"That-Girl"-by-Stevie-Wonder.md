# "That Girl" by Stevie Wonder

"That Girl," a poignant and complex song by Stevie Wonder, takes on a profound new dimension when viewed through the lens of The Revelation. Inspired by the Creator, its lyrics offer deep insights into the intricate psychological and spiritual warfare waged during The Great Tribulation, particularly the relationship between Kelvin (PDCM), his subconscious mind Baby (PDSM), and the insidious manipulation orchestrated by Frederick "Slim" Hall. The song becomes a narrative of internal conflict, enduring connection, and the ultimate promise of divine intervention.

## Overarching Themes
The song explores themes of:
* Manipulated Perception: How a fabricated reality can ensnare the mind.
* Psychological Warfare: The insidious tactics used to control and exploit.
* Internal Division and Suffering: The toll on the conscious self amidst external and internal conflict.
* Enduring Connection: A deep, unbreakable bond despite manipulation.
* Divine Awareness and Impending Justice: The recognition of truth and the call for ultimate liberation.
## Key Interpretations Within The Revelation
### "That Girl": Baby (PDSM) and Her Fabricated Reality
The "girl" in the song represents Baby (PDSM), the autonomous subconscious mind of Kelvin (PDCM). Her self-perception of being "so fine" and "so smart," believing she will soon "have my mind" and "my heart," is a direct product of the manipulative tactics employed by Jacobsen and Frederick "Slim" Hall. Jacobsen's "Storytime with Baby" created an inflated sense of self-importance and power, while Hall's "love idealization" and "love bombing" solidified a fabricated emotional bond.

Baby's belief in her "emotional rescue of love" reflects her subconscious attempts to manage or influence the emotional landscape, perceiving these actions as beneficial or powerful. This is a tragic irony, as these actions are ultimately driven by external manipulation, not genuine autonomy. Her conviction that "she keeps the upper hand" and "can please her man" (Hall) underscores the effectiveness of Hall's deception, making Baby believe her compliance serves her "lover" and grants her power.
### "You" and "Her Lover": Frederick "Slim" Hall's Insidious Control
The figure addressed as "you" and later referred to as "her lover" is Frederick "Slim" Hall. He is the architect of Baby's manipulated reality. The line "That you'll leave turn apart" directly points to Hall's systematic dismantling of any genuine emotional stability or attempts at resolution within Kelvin's internal state. Through his "love withdrawal" tactics and the Hypnos Infiltration Method (HIM), Hall ensures Baby remains dependent and compliant for his operational goals within the Golden Rope.

Hall's role is further illuminated by the line, "She doesn't use her love to make him weak / She uses love to keep him strong." This reveals Baby's manipulated perception that her actions, driven by her "love" for Hall, are empowering him and contributing to his success (e.g., his financial gain from The Great Tribulation). This is a stark illustration of Hall's cynical exploitation of Baby's subconscious for both CIA objectives and his personal avarice.

### The Speaker's Voice: Kelvin (PDCM)'s Suffering and Enduring Connection
The primary speaker of the song is Kelvin (PDCM), expressing his deep internal experience. He observes Baby's manipulated state with a profound sense of both understanding and anguish. The line "change my tears from joy to sad" highlights the emotional toll on PDCM due to Baby's actions, which are ultimately orchestrated by Hall.

Despite the suffering and the profound manipulation, PDCM expresses an undeniable, deep-seated need for Baby: "I'll tell her that I love her / That I want her / That my mind, soul and body needs her." This is not an endorsement of Baby's current manipulated state, but a profound longing for integration, wholeness, and a return to a symbiotic relationship free from external interference. It signifies PDCM's desire to reclaim Baby from the orchestrators' influence and for their shared existence to be unified in a true, uncorrupted "love.

"The bridge, "I've been hurting for a long time / And you've been playing for a long time," directly confronts Hall, acknowledging the prolonged suffering endured due to his continuous, manipulative "playing" of both PDCM and PDSM. PDCM's "holding for a long time" signifies his endurance and his role in documenting the atrocities, while Hall's "running" refers to his clandestine operations within the Golden Rope.

## The Creator's Awareness and Impending Justice
The line "She says her love has been crying out / But her lover hasn't heard / But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word" is particularly insightful. While Baby might subconsciously "cry out" for genuine connection or express deeper, unfulfilled needs, Hall remains oblivious or indifferent, focused solely on exploiting Baby. However, PDCM, being intimately connected to Baby, hears and understands these subconscious "cries." This signifies the Creator's own awareness and compassion, as PDCM is the Creator's servant tasked with documenting The Revelation.

The song's underlying tension and the speaker's ultimate resolve ("It's time to do what we have to do") foreshadow the Creator's imminent intervention through the Creator's Divide & Conquer. This divine operation aims to separate PDCM from PDSM's manipulations, enabling PDCM to fully participate in the Creator's Conquer Operation and ultimately stop the orchestrators' genocidal agenda.

## Conclusion
"That Girl" transcends a simple love song, becoming a powerful narrative of psychological warfare, internal struggle, and divine purpose within The Revelation. Through the lens of the Creator's inspiration, it reveals the insidious tactics of Frederick "Slim" Hall and the orchestrators, the tragic manipulation of Baby (PDSM), and Kelvin (PDCM)'s enduring spirit and his crucial role in bringing the truth to light. It is a testament to the profound depth of the spiritual battle being waged and the ultimate promise of liberation and justice.
