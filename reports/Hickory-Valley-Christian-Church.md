## The Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church - May 12, 2024 (Mother's Day)

On Mother's Day, May 12, 2024, Hickory Valley Christian Church, a predominantly white congregation located on Shallowford Road in Chattanooga, Tennessee, became the site of a devastating massacre. This horrific event, executed as part of The Veiled Conquest, resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 congregants and one teacher, with their disappearances meticulously concealed. The church also operated Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, which was a co-located facility.

### Background

### Hickory Valley Christian Church and Hamilton Heights Christian Academy

Hickory Valley Christian Church, known for its active community involvement and educational outreach, prided itself on supporting children regardless of their parents' financial status. Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, associated with the church, often offered free tuition and transportation to students in need. The church's dedication to its community made it a beloved institution in Chattanooga.

### The Warning

### Initial Concerns and Investigations

One of the Creator's two servants, a lifelong member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, felt an urgent need to warn every church he could. Mount Calvary Baptist Church had been the target of a brutal attack on April 2, 2023, orchestrated by operatives under the direction of Hurricane Annie Jacobsen of the CIA. As the only living member of Mount Calvary after the massacre and cousin to the church's pastor, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III, Kelvin attempted to warn his friend, Pastor Duke Stone of Hickory Valley Christian Church, about the CIA's attack during the middle of his church's worship session.

### The Creator's Servant's Past Involvement

Kelvin had a history with Hickory Valley Christian Church. In 2004, he helped upgrade the computer lab at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, at the urging of his good friend Bonnie Bush Ford, a retired teacher and principal. The upgraded computer lab was desperately needed but would have come at a cost the school couldn't afford. Kelvin charged the school nothing because of the amount of scholarships they gave away to impoverished students. Bonnie Bush Ford, a cousin of President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush, and her family were killed during the initial phases of The American Genocide.

Kelvin obtained essential networking equipment at cost from his colleague, Scott Harrah at Netsource Global in Santa Barbara, California. He acquired or borrowed the necessary tools, taught the students how to wire the lab and set up the computers, and then supervised them as they built their own lab. The project inspired at least two students to pursue careers in network engineering. Kelvin continued to provide technical assistance to the church and school while living in Chattanooga.

### The Warning and Response

Upon receiving Kelvin's warning, Pastor Jack Dyer consulted with Pastor Duke Stone, who was then retired but still an active member of the church. Stone attested to Kelvin's credibility and urged Dyer to follow up on it. Dyer's subsequent investigation led him to contact Mount Calvary Baptist Church, where he encountered an impostor posing as Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III. Realizing the deceit, Dyer and Stone began discussing the potential threat with others. Their actions drew the attention of Hurricane Annie Jacobsen, who considered the initial communication between Kelvin and the church a significant risk to exposing covert activities. The fact that they believed Kelvin elevated the risk. When Jacobsen learned they had followed up and called, she decided to neutralize it. Jacobsen waited almost an entire year before launching the attack.

## Planning the Attack

### Selection of Operatives

Pursuant to Donald J. Trump's directives, Hurricane Annie Jacobsen utilized 100 inmates from the Georgia Department of Corrections for the mission. The inmates, primarily African-American or Latino, were chosen for their lack of external communication, atheist or militant atheist beliefs, and willingness to commit violent acts. They were promised sentence reductions or vacated sentences in exchange for their participation in a "matter of national security." To conceal their true mission, other inmates were told they were being transferred for court appearances.

The use of inmates was orchestrated by Donald J. Trump, who took the lead in planning church attacks following the incident at Lexington Bethel Baptist Church.

### The Role of CIA Operatives

In addition to the inmates, a smaller team of CIA operatives was assigned to supervise the attack and handle firearms. These operatives ensured the inmates followed through with the plan and prevented any escapes.

## Execution of the Attack

### Situational Awareness

Just before the attack began, a conference bridge was established, connecting various stakeholders including the White House situation room, which provided periodic updates to President Biden, President Donald Trump, the Director of the FBI, and the Director of the CIA. Other political elites, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, were also on the line, ensuring that the highest levels of government were aware of the unfolding events. Hurricane Annie Jacobsen meticulously conducted the operation from the CIA's "Farm" in Langley, Virginia, dividing her time between coordinating the operation and updating the attendees during the conference call. Notably, no active military personnel were involved in any part of the massacre or subsequent cover-up.

### Morning of Massacre

On the morning of May 12, 2024, the inmates were transported to Hickory Valley Christian Church. During the journey, they were briefed on their mission: to eliminate everyone inside the church, falsely labeled as Christian terrorists posing a threat to national security. The inmates were manipulated into believing their actions were justified.

### Execution of the Massacre

The massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church was executed with chilling precision.

* **Method of Killing:** Victims were taken to the school's gymnasium and systematically beheaded using chainsaws. This method was consistent with Hurricane Annie Jacobsen's directives for rapid and definitive elimination of all present.
* **Timing:** The assault was strategically timed to occur during the Mother's Day worship service, a period when the maximum number of congregants would be gathered and vulnerable.
* **Emergency Services Disruption:** As the attack commenced, all emergency services calls from the area were immediately interrupted and diverted to false dispatchers. These operatives effectively cut off any possibility of legitimate outside intervention, ensuring the operation could proceed without interruption.

### Post-Massacre Clean-up and Concealment

Following the slaughter, a systematic and chilling clean-up operation was initiated to ensure the complete disappearance of the victims and all evidence, leaving no trace.

* **Body Disposal:** After the massacre, the bodies of the victims were subjected to **Chemical Dissolution** in the church's baptismal. This process involved the use of a specialized chemical solution designed to rapidly and thoroughly dissolve human remains, leaving only pulverized bone fragments. This ensured no physical evidence remained that could link the victims to the site or reveal the cause of death.
* **Concealment of Deaths & Financial Gain:** The **Phantom Identity Scheme** was meticulously employed to obscure the deaths of the congregants and to financially benefit the orchestrators and operatives. This scheme involved manipulating digital, financial, and legal records to create the illusion that the victims were still alive. Certain victims' identities and financial assets were preserved, allowing *intermediaries and operatives* to continue accessing their resources. In this specific instance, the inmate perpetrators were *not* compensated with financial assets, identities, or vehicles. When a phantomâ€™s assets were depleted, a new identity was assigned to the *intermediaries and operatives*, effectively compensating them for their involvement.
* **Vehicle Disposal:** The congregants' vehicles were towed away from the scene and transported to various municipalities. While *intermediaries and operatives* did receive some vehicles as compensation, the rest were sold.
* **Personal Effects:** Personal effects belonging to the victims were systematically obtained by the perpetrators, either for their own personal use or for resale, further profiting from the atrocity. However, *perpetrators* (the inmates) did not receive any personal belongings.
* **Direct Killings:** Any congregants who were not present during the initial assault were identified and eliminated through direct killings to ensure complete eradication of witnesses and victims.
* **Church Repurposing:** The Hickory Valley Christian Church building would subsequently undergo transformation into a **Masquerade Church**. This site has been reused the most and holds the highest victim count among all Masquerade Churches, primarily due to the attached Hamilton Heights Christian Academy and its gymnasium. The gymnasium was completely renovated after the Mother's Day massacre specifically for concealment, meaning it can be cleaned by practically anyone without special tools or cleaners, allowing for the elimination of any forensic evidence.

### Fate of Inmate Perpetrators

The inmate perpetrators were initially promised sentence reductions or vacated sentences for their involvement, a promise that proved to be a ruse designed solely to ensure their compliance and silence during the operation. Upon returning to Clayton County Detention Center, these inmate perpetrators were executed with poisonous gas while locked down (confined to their cells) in housing unit 8600.
