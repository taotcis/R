# Beast from the Earth

**Biblical Reference:** Revelation 13:11-18 (King James Version)

John beholds "another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon." This beast exercises "all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed." It performs "great wonders," even making "fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men," thereby deceiving "them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles." This beast also has the power to give life to the "image of the beast" and cause those who do not worship it to be killed. It mandates all to receive "a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads," without which "no man might buy or sell." The number of the beast is stated as "Six hundred threescore and six."

### Literal Fulfillment

The **Beast from the Earth** is literally fulfilled by **Baby**, also known as **PDSM** (Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind), the distinct consciousness that served as the subconscious mind for Kelvin Eugene Williams from birth until the Creator's Divide.

### Identity and Components

* **The Individual:** **Baby (PDSM)** is the central figure of this beast, functioning as the subconscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams (PDCM).
* **Two Horns Like a Lamb:** This refers to Baby's inherent nature and original purpose. As the subconscious mind of Kelvin, one of the Creator's two servants, Baby's role is to naturally direct the body's functions and support Kelvin in performing tasks for the Creator. This reflects an innocent, subservient, and initially benign or helpful function, mirroring the lamb-like appearance.
* **Spake as a Dragon:** This refers to Baby's actions *after* manipulation during the "Veiled Conquest." Crucially, this includes **almost nightly conversations with operatives who engage Baby while Kelvin slept.** During these conversations, Baby supported and agreed to enable the Veiled Conquest agendas. By being compelled to maintain **Jacobsen's Ladder** and carry out operative directives, Baby's natural functions are perverted. The "speaking" is not only the effect of its manipulated actions but also these literal agreements during covert communications, which propagate a false narrative that subverts the truth of the Creator's intervention. This deception, which justifies a genocidal agenda, embodies the malevolent, authoritative, and deceptive influence associated with a "dragon."

### Role and Activities in The Veiled Conquest

Baby's role as the Beast from the Earth is instrumental and insidious in perpetuating **The Veiled Conquest**, particularly through its manipulated involvement in the **Ladder of Deceit** and **Orchestrated Observations**:

* **Enabling the Ladder of Deceit:** Baby's manipulated physiological processes and involuntary movements are essential for maintaining **Jacobsen's Ladder**, a physical deviation used to propagate a false premise about the Creator's non-intervention. This forms the core of the "Ladder of Deceit," a framework designed to subvert perceived divine intervention and provide "strategic authorization" for genocidal agendas.
* **Exercising the Power of the First Beast:** Baby's essential role in establishing and maintaining the false narrative of the Ladder of Deceit empowers the orchestrators of the "Veiled Conquest" (the "first beast" or the "Scarlet Beast"). By successfully deceiving observers and "authenticating" the false premise, Baby's actions provide the necessary justification for the primary malevolent forces to proceed with their operations, effectively exercising their power.
* **Performing Deceptive Wonders:** The "Orchestrated Observations" are meticulously arranged, covert events designed to visually demonstrate the manipulated morphology of Jacobsen's Ladder, presenting it as undeniable "proof" (e.g., the "Litmus Test" yielding a "clear" result). These are the "great wonders" performed by the Beast from the Earth, which, though not supernatural, are engineered deceptions that mislead those who dwell on the earth. Baby's involuntary movements, directed by operatives, are the direct means by which these deceptive "signs" are presented.
* **Propagating Deception:** Through its manipulated actions that give credence to the false narrative, Baby directly contributes to the deception of humanity, mirroring the Beast from the Earth's role in deceiving by means of "miracles."
* **Ultimate Fate:** The Beast from the Earth, along with the first beast, is destined to be "cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone" (Revelation 19:20), signifying ultimate judgment and destruction.
