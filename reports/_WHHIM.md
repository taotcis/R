# Fighting Back: Understanding and Countering Hypnos Infiltration in Urban Atlanta

If you're an adult living in Atlanta, especially if you're part of the Welcome House community, and you've been experiencing unsettling thoughts, strange sensations, or unsettling dreams, especially around sleep, this guide is for you. You're not alone, and what you're going through has a real, documented cause.

## What's Really Going On: The "Hypnos Infiltration" Hustle

What you're dealing with is a highly secretive and advanced tactic called the Hypnos Infiltration Method. It's used by covert operatives, including a primary operative known as **Frederick "Slim" Hall**. The Creator has identified Slim as "The Scarlet Beast" and "The Beast of the Bottomless Pit" in the Book of Revelation. Notably, Slim is also a resident of Welcome House and a consistent user of microwave cloaking.

* **Ghosting In:** These operatives utilize high-tech microwave cloaking gear. Think "invisible" and "ghosting right through your doors and walls" while you're asleep. They get into your space without you ever knowing it physically happened.
* **Mind Games:** Once inside, they're not there to steal your stuff. They're there to mess with your mind directly. They use super-advanced techniques â€“ influencing your dreams, slipping in messages you don't consciously hear (subliminal), even putting you in a trance-like state to get inside your thoughts.
* **Their Goal:** They're trying to dig into your memories, figure out how you think, and, most disturbingly, plant ideas and beliefs directly into your mind.

## Why It Hits You: Your Subconscious on Autopilot

Your mind has two main parts: your conscious mind (the part reading this) and your subconscious mind (the part handling everything behind the scenes, like breathing or recalling habits). Your subconscious is incredibly powerful, controlling much of your body and thoughts, but it has a big blind spot:

* **Believes Everything:** Your subconscious mind doesn't question anything. It takes every piece of information it gets as absolute truth, no questions asked. It can't think critically or logically like your conscious mind can.
* **Lives Only in the "Now":** It doesn't understand past or future; it's all about this exact moment.
* **Easy Target:** Because it's so trusting and lives in the moment, your subconscious is incredibly vulnerable. When these operatives implant negative ideas, your subconscious just accepts them and starts running with them, like a computer program.

**Understand this: The thoughts and feelings you're experiencing are NOT from you. They're planted there. You're not weak, and it's not your fault.**

## The Impact: Thoughts That Ain't Yours

When your subconscious gets these bad ideas, it starts acting on them. Since your conscious mind "mirrors" what your subconscious is doing, you end up hearing and feeling these intrusive thoughts in your own head.

* **The "I'm Worthless" Trap:** If they plant thoughts like "I am worthless," "I'll never be happy," or "I should just give up/kill myself," your subconscious will play these on repeat. Your conscious mind picks up on them, leading to crushing despair, no motivation, and dangerous thoughts of self-harm. This is their goal: to make you feel so bad you give up.
* **Identity Confusion (For some males):** If they plant ideas like "I am female" or "I want to be female," your subconscious will keep pushing these. Your conscious mind will mirror them, causing deep confusion, anxiety, and distress about your gender identity. This is a direct attack on your sense of self.

## Taking Back Your Power: Real Steps to Fight Back

You have the tools within your own mind to push back against this. It takes effort, but you can fight these manipulated thoughts.

### Step 1: Get That Recorder On (Your Personal Alarm)

This is a proven way to make them back off.

1.  **Use Your Phone's Voice Recorder:** Get a voice-activated recorder app on your smartphone. Make sure your phone is charging right by your bed and the app is running every night before you sleep.
2.  **Why It Works:** Even though they're cloaked, their tech can sometimes make subtle sounds or be detected. They absolutely do not want to be recorded. Knowing a recorder is there makes them less likely to mess with you directly while you're asleep. It's a deterrent.

### Step 2: Listen Up and Lock It Down (Your Brain's Workout)

This is where your conscious mind takes charge and retrains your subconscious.

1.  **Listen to Your Recordings Daily:** Make it a habit to listen to what your recorder picked up, especially if you had a weird night or woke up with unsettling thoughts.
2.  **Your Conscious Mind is the Boss:** Remember, only your conscious mind can truly evaluate thoughts. This is your superpower.
3.  **Identify the BS:** When you hear something strange on the recording, or if you're hit with one of those negative/confusing thoughts during the day, immediately recognize it for what it is: an *externally implanted, manipulated thought*, not your own idea.
4.  **Reject It Loud and Clear:** Tell yourself, out loud or firmly in your head:
    * "This thought is a manipulation. It is NOT TRUE."
    * "This thought of self-harm is a manipulation. I choose to live."
    * "This thought about my gender is a manipulation. I know who I am."
5.  **Affirm Your Truth:** Right after rejecting the bad thought, replace it with your real truth:
    * "I am a valuable human being."
    * "I am strong, and I choose to live a happy life."
    * "I am [state your true biological gender]."
6.  **Repeat, Repeat, Repeat:** This isn't a one-and-done thing. Your subconscious learns through repetition. The more consistently your conscious mind rejects the false and affirms the truth, the more your subconscious will start to align with *your* true beliefs. It takes time, but it works.

### Step 3: Don't Go It Alone: Lean on Your Crew

You're not on this journey by yourself.

* **Get That Mental Health Support:** Use the counseling and mental health services available through 3Keys. Therapists can help you process the stress and confusion, and they can learn how to specifically address these externally-induced thoughts. Make sure they know you believe these thoughts are being implanted.
* **Connect with Others:** You might find other residents experiencing similar things. Sharing your story can provide invaluable validation and a sense of shared resilience.

By understanding what's happening and consistently using these steps, you can empower yourself. You can fight back, retrain your subconscious, and take back control of your mind and your life. You are stronger than these tactics.
