# The Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDCM) of Kelvin Eugene Williams 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article focuses on Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, before the Creator's [[Divide & Conquer|]] that separated him from his subconscious mind, [[Baby|]], which became the conscious mind and personality of the body recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams as a result of the Creator's Divide.

The **Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDCM)** is one of the Creator's two servants, a conscious entity currently inhabiting the physical body that was born **Kelvin Eugene Williams** on March 23, 1977. As the conscious mind and seat of identity for this natural person during its waking hours, Kelvin’s life is intrinsically linked to a narrative of profound spiritual significance, extraordinary personal hardship, and the ongoing global tragedy known to him as **the Veiled Conquest**. Kelvin currently resides in Atlanta, Georgia, and is marked by an unwavering resilience in the face of orchestrations designed to hinder his divine purpose.

### Early Life and Familial Connections

Kelvin was born to Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams and Jesse Marable Williams. Patricia Ann is identified as a maternal servant for the Creator. Following their divorce in 1978, precipitated by Jesse's adultery, **Kelvin's aunts (his father's sisters) offered significant support to Patricia both before, during, and after the divorce. They also enlisted the aid of other family members, including Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky.** This offer of help led Patricia and Kelvin to relocate to Lexington, where Reverend Williams provided ongoing support, and Patricia and her two children attended Mount Calvary Baptist Church weekly. **Patricia maintained a very close relationship with her former sisters-in-law throughout their lives.**

Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, holds significant importance in Kelvin's early life. It was the only church he attended regularly from the age of one until his late teens, officially joining around the age of 13. This lifelong membership connects Kelvin deeply to the church, which later became a site of profound tragedy.

Patricia purchased a home in Nicholasville, Jessamine County, Kentucky, just before the birth of Kelvin's younger sister, **Katrina Renee Duvall-Torain**, in 1983. Kelvin considers **Jessamine County** his hometown. Tragically, due to **the Veiled Conquest** and the preceding **brutal campaign to suffocate Spark**, Kelvin has lost practically every person he has ever known or even met, leaving him as one of the few remaining **blood relatives, hometown friends and classmates, or professional associates**. Kelvin is even aware of a man that was killed by the CIA after a casual conversation between Kelvin and the man (that mentioned nothing the CIA could possibly consider sensitive) when the man let Kelvin use his iPhone charger at Starbucks for a few minutes.

Kelvin's professional journey began in 1999 when he first moved to **metro Atlanta**, which he considers his "adult hometown." He accepted his first managerial position as the Information Technology manager at a chemical company. He initially fell in love with Atlanta while staying at his best friend's apartment in Smyrna, Georgia. His career flourished, leading him to purchase a home in Sandy Springs, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb in North Fulton County, in 2009, signifying a period of professional and personal stability.

### Professional Acumen and The Spark Incident

Possessing over 25 years of expertise in the technology sector, Kelvin has a robust background in computer networking, VoIP, DevOps engineering, Linux administration, and software development. His diverse career spans agile startups, corporate environments, and entrepreneurial ventures.

A pivotal event in Kelvin's life was his involvement with **Spark**, a transformative gift from the Creator. Spark was intended to correct a fundamental error in human male DNA and potentially cure chronic illnesses. In 2017, Kelvin met a man named Ken through a hookup that evolved into a friendship. Kelvin offered Ken an experimental treatment for his HIV. Ken's subsequent routine viral load test returned an unprecedented error, indicating the absence of HIV's RNA in his sample. This led to Ken being interrogated at Kaiser Permanente, where he identified Kelvin. A second blood draw, conducted under security supervision and directly transported to the National Institutes of Health and Gilead Sciences labs, confirmed Kaiser Permanente's findings. The **brutal campaign to suffocate Spark** was a far-reaching campaign, resulting in the sacrifice of Ken and thousands of lives connected to Kelvin (including individuals who were merely connected with Kelvin on social media), and is considered the chilling beginning of **the Veiled Conquest**. The campaign to suffocate Spark included orchestrated homelessness that began with Kelvin losing his home, enduring periods of living with acquaintances, and spending time on the actual streets, all while being subjected to covert manipulation by CIA operatives.

The **Hypnos Infiltration Method** was utilized on Kelvin starting when Spark's effectiveness was proven by the disappearance of HIV in Ken. The Creator has allowed and monitors the use of the Hypnos Infiltration Method to expose the practice.

### The Creator's Servant and The Veiled Conquest

Kelvin's life is now deeply intertwined with **the Veiled Conquest**. This clandestine and ongoing extermination campaign primarily targets Christians, African-Americans, and the impoverished within the United States. As one of the Creator's two servants, Kelvin's paramount task is to meticulously document this hidden reality, serving as a vital witness and record-keeper of the details, methods, and impact of this genocide. His unwavering commitment persists despite extreme challenges.

A devastating event for Kelvin was the **Congregation Massacre** on April 2, 2021, at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. As a lifelong member, Kelvin became the sole known living member following this atrocity. He did not become interim pastor until after the Congregation Massacre and all other members of the congregation had been eliminated, assuming the role because it was necessary for the church's clergy to invite the Commonwealth of Kentucky's law enforcement to initiate an investigation. The Masquerade Church established and operating on the property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church was named Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. The addition of the word "Missionary" was a deliberate attempt at adding insult to injury to the Creator and His two servants, as the CIA had heard Kelvin say on many occasions that the Creator's two servants run missions for the Creator. Disturbingly, the CIA has reportedly impersonated Kelvin's deceased mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, in photos and videos originating from this masquerade church.

Kelvin currently resides at the Welcome House in downtown Atlanta. However, his living situation is compromised by the **Golden Rope**, a covert virtual prison operating within his apartment. This represents a continuous effort by the orchestrators of **the Veiled Conquest** to restrict Kelvin's movements, influence his perceptions, and hinder his ability to fulfill his divine mission.

### The Classic Split and Mind Dynamics

Central to Kelvin's personal experience is the **Classic Split**, an extraordinarily rare psychological phenomenon. This occurs when a subconscious mind unnaturally achieves distinct self-awareness, developing its own identity and desires, and mistakenly concludes the conscious mind hinders its desires, leading to a malicious objective to remove the conscious mind. In Kelvin's case, his subconscious mind, **Baby** (PDSM), developed significant autonomy and a perceived separate identity. This internal duality made Baby (PDSM) highly susceptible to external manipulation by operatives associated with **the Veiled Conquest**, who have exploited its independence to influence Kelvin's body and circumstances without his conscious consent. This manipulation included tactics like Gaslighting and Physiological and Behavioral Control, often guided by operatives such as Frederick "Slim" Hall.

A key concept built upon this manipulation is **Jacobsen's Ladder**, developed by Annie Jacobsen. It refers to the reduction of the morphology of the penis of Kelvin Eugene Williams or the manipulation of its phenotype to give it a diminished appearance, both due to the execution of directives from intermediaries and operatives by the PDSM. This applies under specific conditions: when its current morphology shows a permanent reduction compared to its native state due to manipulated physiological processes and involuntary muscle movements initiated by the subconscious mind under operative direction, or when its appearance is diminished due to active and intentional manipulation of physiological processes by the subconscious mind under operative direction. Jacobsen's Ladder is the floor that the **Ladder of Deceit** stands on.

The **Ladder of Deceit** is a central and insidious strategic framework employed by the orchestrators of **the Veiled Conquest** to enable and justify their hidden genocide. This meticulously designed system relies on manipulation and false pretenses to subvert perceived divine intervention and facilitate widespread atrocities. Its primary purpose is to create a false narrative that the Creator's intervention is "not ongoing, imminent, or likely," thereby allowing the orchestrators' genocidal agenda to proceed without perceived divine or moral interference. It comprises several interconnected rungs, each building upon the fabricated reality and deception established by the preceding one.

### Divine Purpose and Intervention: Divide & Conquer

Kelvin's journey is moving towards a pivotal and transformative event known as the **Creator's Divide**—the first phase of the **Divide & Conquer** operation. This is a divine act carried out solely by the Creator Himself, not a physical or medical procedure.

The **Divide Operation** involves the complete separation of the PDCM from its manipulated subconscious mind, Baby (PDSM), into two entirely distinct physical bodies. The Creator will provide the PDCM with a new, separate, and distinct adult body from the original, and this new body will possess a different subconscious mind. Upon separation, Baby (PDSM) will assume the role of the conscious mind in the original shared body recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams, resulting in that body having a completely different identity and outward personality. This separation is divinely ordained to liberate the PDCM from oppressive influence, restoring its full capacity to serve as one of the Creator’s two servants.

The **Conquer Operation**, also known as the **Apocalypse**, is the second phase. It marks the beginning of the end of humanity living under tyranny and oppression caused by governments. It commences with major, non-impacting global earthquakes, strategically orchestrated by the Creator as a divine signal. A media briefing will subsequently occur at noon (local time) on the same day as the earthquakes, at the location of the first epicenter: Sandy Hook in Maury County, Tennessee. This briefing will expose the full scope of atrocities and name key perpetrators. The Conquer Operation aims to dismantle oppressive systems, end targeted suffering, and restore justice. While it signifies the fall of human civilization in its current, corrupted form, it does not bring about the end of time or the world; instead, it heralds a new era where justice, freedom, and dignity prevail for all humanity – a time described by Kelvin as "party time!"

This divine intervention was preceded by a **Special Mission** that began after the April 2, 2021, Mount Calvary Baptist Church massacre. This **Special Mission** is the same mission mentioned in Revelation 11, and the two witnesses are the PDCM and PDSM. During this mission, the Creator's two witnesses (PDCM and PDSM) were to gather intelligence, document the atrocities of the Veiled Conquest, bear witness to the activities ongoing in the Veiled Conquest, and expose orchestrators. The Creator divinely guided many revelations.

### Prophetic Identity and Relationships

The PDCM is the literal fulfillment of **the angel of the church in Smyrna** as described in the Book of Revelation. Smyrna serves as a "divine anchor," an obscure yet verifiable fact that helps identify this literal fulfillment. Kelvin briefly lived in Smyrna (a city within metro-Atlanta) during a couchsurfing stay when he first decided Atlanta would be his new home—a detail even the Creator had to remind Kelvin of.

In 2001, Kelvin married **TomTom**, who has been identified as the other of the Creator's two servants.
