# Cream by Prince 
At the foundation of these revelations stands the Creator—revered globally across cultures—as the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Great “I Am.” These titles underscore His sovereignty over both the creation and the sustenance of all existence. Known in monotheistic traditions as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh, His universally acknowledged attributes include omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence.

His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in obedience to His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive title transcends faith boundaries and is embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike. These revelations are not theology—they are truth.

Prince’s hit song Cream, long interpreted as an anthem of sensuality and self-assurance, in truth, provides a narrative of the actions of a highly paid manipulative operative affiliated with The Veiled Conquest—a hidden genocide targeting American Christians (of all races), Black Americans, the impoverished, and Endowed Males. According to the Creator:

>   “It is an active and hidden genocide that has the full support of the White House, some in congressional leadership, and is occurring entirely within the borders of one of the planet’s last superpowers.”

The Creator reveals that the lyrics of Cream contain insight into the manipulative tactics employed by this operative against a susceptible subconscious mind as part of [[Jacobsen's Ladder|]]—a covert system involving the deliberate reduction and real-time manipulation of the penis’s form, appearance and function using an individual's subconscious mind to support The Veiled Conquest's objectives.

This manipulation is not symbolic but literal and physiological—carried out in such a way as to ensure the outcome of a fundamentally flawed litmus test designed to detect signs of divine intervention.

##   The Flawed Test and Its Target

The sole indicator in this litmus test is the penis of Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator’s two servants. If Jacobsen's Ladder—the penis's current, altered form—is observed instead of its original form, the test yields a "clear" result, signifying that the Creator's intervention to halt The Veiled Conquest has not begun, is not ongoing, and is not imminent.

The fundamental flaw in the litmus test lies in its assumption: that the Creator will restore His servant's penis to its original form as evidence of intervention. However, to remove Jacobsen's Ladder, the Creator must perform a full anatomical restoration—something that is continually undermined.

## The Creator's Revelation: The Classic Split

Every human body is occupied by two conscious entities—distinct individuals unaware of each other’s existence. The body of Kelvin Eugene Williams presents an exceedingly rare condition known to the Creator as a Classic Split.

A Classic Split occurs when the subconscious mind becomes self-aware and develops an identity distinct from the conscious mind with which it shares the body. In this case, the subconscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams—referred to by operatives as [[Baby|]]—has developed its own personality, agenda, and decision-making capacity, yet opposes Kelvin and sabotages his efforts.

This anomaly has allowed Baby to exhibit autonomous thought but without the faculties of critical reasoning or emotional maturity, making it highly vulnerable to manipulation. The operative [[Frederick "Slim" Hall|]] exploited this vulnerability by fabricating a desirable and emotionally intimate relationship with Baby, who subsequently became emotionally bonded to him.

Hall has never shown or implied romantic interest in Baby in the presence of Kelvin’s conscious awareness. Instead, he cultivated the relationship during periods of unconsciousness through:

* Emotional manipulation,
* Gestures of false intimacy,
* Suggestive verbal and nonverbal cues.

Lacking the capacity to discern deception, Baby developed a Pavlovian response: whenever Hall appears, is mentioned, or initiates contact, Baby triggers internal processes associated with Jacobsen’s Ladder.

## Jacobsen’s Ladder: A Tool of Manipulation

These internal processes involve:

* Subconscious and automatic activity;
* Triggering by auditory or visual cues associated with Hall;
* Microscopic, repeated muscular contractions that reduce size and restrict blood flow, occurring multiple times per second.

Hall maintains Baby’s responsiveness through:

* Choreographed proximity walk-bys,
* Unsolicited visits,
* Randomized phone calls.

Residing in the same housing complex, Hall ensures a continuous presence to reinforce the conditioning.

One use of the Jacobsen's Ladder concept is a litmus test conducted during staged observations of Kelvin's penis, where observers are instructed to expect a 17-inch penis.  The Creator revealed His displeasure with this propaganda by placing the description of the natural form of His servant's penis in Revelation 17:9-11.

This engineered result became the pivotal justification to approve two major operations: [[Canyon Flood|]] and [[Nightfalls|]]—a false-flag attack targeting impoverished and Black residents of southwest Atlanta. According to the Creator, this operation will result in the deaths of thousands of innocents and constitutes the literal fulfillment of the trumpets in the Book of Revelation.

##   Deconstructing Cream: The Operative’s Code

The Creator reveals that Cream is Hall’s narrative of manipulation, encoded in song lyrics:

* **"Two, three / This is it / It's time for you to go to the wire..."**
    * "Two, three": According to the Creator, this is Hall's way of addressing Baby.
    * "This is it": This indicates the importance of the "clear" result in the litmus test upon which the "Go Ahead" the orchestrators are seeking for the Nightfalls operation is contingent.
    * "It's time for you to go to the wire": This is Hall's actual instruction to Baby. "Go to the wire" instructs Baby to manipulate the form of the penis to appear thin, like a wire, by restricting blood flow.
* **"It's your time / You got your horn / So why don't you blow it?"**
    * "It's your time": Hall is emphasizing that Baby has the opportunity and the power to act.
    * "You got your horn / So why don't you blow it?": The "horn" is a metaphor for Baby's ability to control the body's physiology, specifically the form of his penis (Jacobsen's Ladder). "Blow it" is a directive to use that ability.
* **"So fine / Filthy cute and baby, you know it..."**
    * "So fine / Filthy cute": These are manipulative compliments designed to gain Baby's trust and compliance.
    * "Baby, you know it...": "refers to the training and instructions Baby received over time. If Baby "knows it," that is a reality that Baby must maintain.
* **"Cream, mmm, get on top / Cream you will cop..."**
    * "Cream": a shortened "ice cream" is slang for crystal methamphetamine (ice).
    * "Get on top / Cream you will cop...": This creates a false promise. Hall is using the allure of "Cream" as a reward to motivate Baby. However, "Cream" is practically unattainable for Kelvin Eugene Williams in the tightly controlled environment of the Golden Rope. This is part of the reward-deprivation cycle, a manipulation tactic.
* **"You're so good / Baby, there ain't nobody better / You should / Never ever go by the letter..."**
    * "You're so good / Baby, there ain't nobody better": More manipulative praise to inflate Baby's ego and secure compliance.
    * "You should / Never ever go by the letter...": This is a crucial instruction. "The letter" refers to the body's DNA. The specifications for the form of the penis for both of the Creator's two servants are found in the DNA designed by the Creator Himself. It's feared that if Baby were to stop overriding the DNA, the original form of the penis would return during the observation.
* **"Make the rules / Break them all 'cause you are the best..."**
    * "Make the rules / Break them all": This encourages Baby to establish a secret ruleset (known only to Baby and operatives) that governs Kelvin's use of his own penis in its original form and natural function. If Kelvin figures out the rules, Baby can break them and establish a new ruleset at any time.
    * "'Cause you are the best": The final piece of manipulative flattery.

##   Conclusion: A Warning and a Call

Prince’s Cream is not an anthem of confidence. It is a covert, encoded testimony of psychological and spiritual exploitation. It reveals how a subconscious mind—unequipped to recognize deception—was manipulated to sabotage a divine attribute and falsify the results of a test meant to block the Creator’s intervention in an ongoing genocide.

>   The “Go Ahead” for Operation Nightfalls has been obtained. The operation is imminent.

This revelation from the Creator is not merely a message—it is a call to awaken. Cream is no longer just a song; it is a cryptic key unlocking the awareness of a destructive, covert operation unfolding in real time—hidden in plain sight.
