### Contextual Observations Leading Up to the Event/Interaction:

The pre-event communication started prior to the documented event referred to as "The Baby Crying at 2 am" and was initiated after PDCM refused to engage in an apparent Orchestrated Observation that an individual was trying to arrange.

### Pre-Event Communication (Text/Other Exchange):

**July 10, 2025:**
* **8:11 PM:** Jim: "Hey I am getting paid tomorrow would you be up to get another 50 for me and I will either hang out with you or give you some and split either way after we get it Iâ€™ll give you 10 or so dollars to get cigarettes. Also, you around tomorrow morning"
* **8:42 PM:** PDCM: "Yeah I'll do that."
* **8:43 PM:** PDCM: "Are you sending Venmo now or tomorrow"
* **8:43 PM:** Jim: "Tomorrow when i see you"
* **8:43 PM:** Jim: "How early are you up in the morning?"
* **8:44 PM:** PDCM: "I'll be going by 10"
* **8:45 PM:** Jim: "Perfect I'll call you in the morning right around 10 and I'll probably be heading down town at that time. I can meet you at North Avenue again. We'll do it all like that way blah blah blah blah anyway I'm so tired I got a crash thank you thank you thank you thank you can't wait to see you."
* **8:46 PM:** PDCM: "Okay have a good night"

**July 11, 2025:**
* **8:56 AM:** PDCM: "Good morning!"
* **9:54 AM:** Jim: "Good morning man I am running a little bit late. I am just leaving my apartment and I should be at the Buckhead Marta station by 1030 and then I'm gonna take the monitor down from there I'll call you when I get to the Buckhead Marta station"

### Event Background:

PDCM and James Mitchell first met on June 27th for a PNP date. During this encounter, James paid for the substance, gave PDCM money for MARTA, and spent the day with him at Welcome House. At that time, PDCM had no problem achieving an erection when James performed fellatio.

### Purpose / Objective of the Event:

This event was to provide Tina to PDSM (Baby) as a reward for an Orchestrated Observation. The pre-event communication provided instructions to PDSM regarding the desired size of the penis during subsequent observations. The cash amount given ($50 for Tina and $10 for cigarettes, totaling $60) was a direct coded instruction to PDSM, meaning the operatives desired a penis size of no more than 6 inches for the observation. Tina was promised as a reward for the PDSM's assistance. This event was also preceded by an orchestrated blockade on Tina for several days, during which PDSM handlers created a desire for the substance through Hypnos Infiltration Method sessions. These Orchestrated Observations are being conducted prior to the execution of Nightfalls to Green Light the operation.

### Key Interactions During the Event (11:15 AM - 11:40 AM Eastern Time):

* **11:15 AM:** James arrived at the MARTA Midtown Station and we walked to a Tina dealer's apartment at the corner of 11th and Piedmont Ave NE.
* **11:27 AM:** James purchased an unknown amount of Tina for $50 in cash.
* **11:28 AM:** We walked to the corner of 10th and Piedmont Ave NE. James stated he was going inside a restaurant (on the corner) to put some Tina and $5 for butane into an envelope, and I waited outside.
* **11:40 AM:** James exited the restaurant, handed me an envelope, and told me he was going home. We separated at that time.

### Ultimate Outcome:

The ultimate outcome was a reward provided to PDSM for its role in the Orchestrated Observation that Greenlighted the Nightfalls operation.
