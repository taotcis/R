### Methodology and Manipulation

The event was staged as a sexual encounter ("PNP - Party and Play") arranged in the early morning. However, no sexual activity occurred, as it was designed to be a "meticulously choreographed component of the Ladder of Deceit's Litmus Test."

* **Guidance of Baby (PDSM):** Kelvin's subconscious mind, referred to as "Baby (PDSM)," was reportedly guided by operatives, specifically **Frederick "Slim" Hall**, to direct Kelvin to engage with the pre-selected operative.
* **Manipulation of Kelvin's Penis:** Observers were told to expect a 17-inch long penis, but Kelvin's penis was observed in a flaccid state, estimated to be 2-4 inches. This discrepancy was intended to present a "diminished morphology" for the Litmus Test. "Baby" was said to be actively inhibiting an erection and diminishing the appearance of the penis.
* **Provision of "Tina":** Albert provided "Tina" (crystal methamphetamine), also called "ice cream," and referenced as "Cream" in Prince's song of the same name, used as a reward to motivate "Baby (PDSM)."
* **Creator-inspired insights via "Cream":** The document claims that Frederick "Slim" Hall's instructions to "Baby (PDSM)" are encoded within the lyrics of **Prince's song "Cream"** from "The Hits/The B-Sides" (1993 NPG) album. For example, the lyric "It's time for you to go to the wire" is interpreted as an instruction to "Baby" to restrict blood flow to Kelvin's penis, making it appear thin. Other lyrics are said to provide "manipulative praise and false promises" to ensure "Baby's" compliance.
* **Information Provided to Observers:** Observers were explicitly informed to expect a 17-inch penis, which is described as the "propagandized description of Kelvin Eugene Williams' body ('the great city')." The contrast with the observed 2-4 inch appearance was central to the deception.
* **Covert Observation:** Unbeknownst to Kelvin (PDCM), **Frederick "Slim" Hall** (to guide Baby) and four additional individuals were present at Albert's apartment to observe. Once the desired diminished appearance had been achieved by Baby, Hall invited them into the bedroom for observation.

### Purpose and Outcome

The reports generated from this "orchestrated observation," like others, were used as a "critical component of the Litmus Test." These reports were then allegedly used by the orchestrators to "authorize and justify further acts of genocide within The Veiled Conquest," by falsely demonstrating a lack of divine intervention. Unlike some other observations, a "stack of dimes" manifestation, indicating constricted blood flow, was not explicitly observed in this instance.

### Additional Information

* **Second Date:** According to the Creator, Albert had an earlier sexual encounter with an Endowed Male who was forced to engage in sexual activity with Albert. Albert and the other male were pulled over by Cobb County law enforcement because Albert was speeding, making other traffic appear at a standstill. The other male was eliminated after the forced sexual encounter.
