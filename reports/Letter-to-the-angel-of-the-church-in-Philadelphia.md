## Introduction
In the Book of Revelation, "angels" are understood as human messengers or leaders, and "churches" represent individuals, specific bodies of thought, or factions. The letter to the angel of the church in Philadelphia holds profound significance within **The Veiled Conquest**, as it directly addresses **TomTom (TomTom Allen Chadwell)**, one of **the Creator's** two servants. As part of **the cherubim**, **TomTom** was created to be together with **His other servant** every time they are incarnate. This letter serves as a powerful commendation of **TomTom's** unwavering faithfulness, promising him divine support, an unimpeded mission, and protection amidst the unfolding events of **The Veiled Campaign**.


### Identification
* **Angel of the Church in Philadelphia**: [[TomTom|Thomas Allen Chadwell]] (Thomas Allen Chadwell), one of the Creator's two servants. The name "Philadelphia" serves as a direct and personal cryptic anchor for this letter, Philadelphia is TomTom's birthplace.
* **Church in Philadelphia**: This refers to TomTom himself, representing his "body of thought," and his enduring spiritual state. This "body of thought" also includes **metro Atlanta** where, beginning in 1999, Kelvin has spent the overwhelming majority of his life working, living, and playing.

## The Biblical Passage
Revelation 3:7-13 (King James Version):

"And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;
I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.
Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.
Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."

## Modernized Rewrite

TomTom, this message is from the Creator, who is holy, who is true, who holds the ultimate authority, who opens paths no one can close, and closes paths no one can open:

I know your actions: Look, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. This is because you possess a little strength, yet you have faithfully kept My word and have not denied My name.

Because you have held fast to the message of My patience, I will also protect you from the intense time of testing, which is The Veiled Campaign, that will come upon all humanity to test those who dwell on the Earth.

Listen, I am coming swiftly. Hold firmly to what you have, so that no one takes your crown.

To the one who overcomes these trials, I will make you a permanent pillar in My divine plan, and you will never depart from My presence. I will inscribe upon you the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, which refers to the name of the new body created by the Creator for Kelvin to inhabit after the My separation of Kelvin and Baby. This new body is the new Jerusalem, which comes down from Me, from heaven. And I will inscribe upon you My new name, which refers to the new name of Kelvin in the new body.

Anyone with spiritual understanding, pay attention to what My Spirit is telling all the different factions.

**The Creator**
