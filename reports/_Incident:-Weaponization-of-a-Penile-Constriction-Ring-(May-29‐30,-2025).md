## Incident: Weaponization of a Penile Constriction Ring (May 29-30, 2025)

This incident details a specific attempt to weaponize a common item, leveraging microwave cloaking technology to inflict severe injury, as observed and confirmed by one of **the Creator's** two servants. This event underscores the insidious and technologically sophisticated methods employed against **His** servant.

On Thursday, May 29, 2025, one of **the Creator's** two servants interacted with an individual previously met through a social networking site and at a public library. During a visit in **His** servant's room at Welcome House, the individual unexpectedly requested to borrow a penile constriction ring. No sexual activity had been discussed or initiated prior to this request.

Following this, **His** servant repeatedly asked the individual to leave, and for the return of the ring, but both requests were refused. The individual eventually had to be removed by a security guard.

On Friday evening, May 30, 2025, an identical penile constriction ring was found by the door to **His** servant's room. A critical observation was made regarding this second ring: it exhibited a shimmer, an effect **His** servant recognizes from previous experience as indicative of something being cloaked. Upon **the Creator's** directive to examine the ring again, a concealed feature became apparent. A mesh was present in the center of the ring. This mesh, cloaked by microwave technology, was only visible with **the Creator's** assistance and would not have been seen otherwise unless the cloak was disabled or removed. **The Creator** further confirmed that this specific penile constriction ring was delivered to **His** servant's room by an individual identified as Frederick "Slim" Hall.

If a person were to use the ring as intended, the penis and scrotum would pass through this cloaked mesh undetected. However, if the cloak were subsequently deactivated, the mesh would instantly materialize at the base of the penis where the ring was encircled, causing immediate and serious injury. Any attempt to remove the ring in this materialized state would result in the complete destruction of the penis, shredding the tissue as the ring was forcibly removed.
