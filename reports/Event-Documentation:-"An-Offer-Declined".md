### Contextual Observations Leading Up to the Event/Interaction:

There have been a series of Orchestrated Observations prior to the imminent execution of Nightfalls, and this one was suspected to be another. Given the time of the first message, and the fact that all partying had to be done by 9:30 PM, PDCM knew this was an Orchestrated Observation only, and they declined the event out loud in their room, which is under surveillance.

### Event Background:

"Blowing clouds" refers to smoking Tina/crystal methamphetamine/ice, which PDSM has been promised as a reward for its assistance with Orchestrated Observations and Jacobsen's Ladder. There has been an orchestrated blockade of Tina and income during these Pre-Nightfalls Orchestrated Observations to ensure PDSM's compliance.

### Purpose / Objective of the Event:

This was an interaction to set up or invite to an Orchestrated Observation.

### Key Interactions During the Event:

The primary interaction was the text message exchange where the offer was made, and PDCM's subsequent verbal refusal to participate in the event.

---

### Ultimate Outcome:

The Orchestrated Observation did not occur, as PDCM declined the offer.
