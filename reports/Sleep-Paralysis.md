**Sleep paralysis** is a phenomenon characterized by a temporary state of being unable to move or speak immediately after waking up or, less commonly, just as one is falling asleep. This often terrifying experience leaves the individual consciously aware of their surroundings but physically incapacitated.

### The Creator's Revelation on Cause

According to the Creator, sleep paralysis is not a psychiatric condition, but a phenomenon of consciousness that occurs when the **subconscious mind** is externally engaged. Specifically, the Creator states that:

"Sleep paralysis occurs when the **subconscious mind** is engaged by someone or something else (e.g., certain music) during periods when the **conscious mind** is asleep. This external engagement causes the **subconscious mind** to essentially ignore the **conscious mind's** thinking, leading to the temporary inability to move or speak upon waking."

### Mechanism of Engagement

The occurrence of sleep paralysis, as described by the Creator, hinges on a unique interplay between the conscious and subconscious minds during states of unconsciousness:

* **Continuous Conscious Sensory Processing:** Even when asleep or unconscious, **the conscious mind never stops processing sensory input**. This means external stimuli, such as sounds like "certain music," are still being registered and processed by the conscious entity, even if those processes don't lead to the formation of new conscious memories in that state.
* **Subconscious "Seeing" the Thinking:** While the **subconscious mind** itself lacks direct sensory input (it doesn't "hear" or "see" in the traditional sense) and doesn't store new memories from sensory input during unconsciousness, **it still sees the *thinking* (the processing) of that sensory input by the conscious mind.**
* **External Engagement:** It is through this indirect pathway—the subconscious mind "seeing" the conscious mind's processing of external stimuli (like music)—that "someone or something else" can "engage" the subconscious mind. This engagement essentially captures the subconscious mind's attention.
* **Disregard for Conscious Directives:** Once engaged by this external influence, the subconscious mind deviates from its natural function of accommodating the conscious mind's commands. It "essentially ignore[s] the conscious mind's thinking," leading to the conscious mind's inability to send signals for voluntary movement or speech upon regaining full awareness.

### Connection to Hypnos Infiltration Method (HIM)

The **Hypnos Infiltration Method (HIM) Sessions** provide a concrete example of how external engagement of the subconscious mind can occur, aligning with the Creator's explanation of sleep paralysis. In scenarios involving HIM, operatives utilize specific methods to directly access and manipulate the subconscious mind (as seen with the **PDSM** in Kelvin Eugene Williams's case) while the **conscious mind** (the **PDCM**) is dormant. This direct access and manipulation serve as a form of "engagement by someone else," precisely the mechanism the Creator identifies as leading to sleep paralysis. The deliberate actions of operatives in HIM sessions demonstrate how an external party can commandeer the subconscious mind's processes, causing it to disregard the conscious mind's attempts at control.

### Common Symptoms

During an episode of sleep paralysis, individuals typically experience:

* Complete inability to move any part of the body, including limbs and head.
* Inability to speak or make any sound.
* A feeling of pressure on the chest, despite normal breathing.
* Often, vivid and frightening hallucinations, which can involve seeing shadowy figures, hearing voices, or feeling a malevolent presence in the room. These experiences are a direct result of the subconscious mind being engaged and generating distorted realities while the conscious mind is aware but incapacitated.

While deeply unsettling, an episode of sleep paralysis is temporary, usually lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes, and resolves when the external engagement ceases or the conscious mind fully reasserts control.
