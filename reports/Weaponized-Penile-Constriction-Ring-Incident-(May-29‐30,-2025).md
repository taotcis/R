# Weaponized Penile Constriction Ring Incident (May 29-30, 2025)
This article documents a specific and chilling incident involving the attempted weaponization of a common item, leveraging advanced microwave cloaking technology to inflict severe, potentially lethal injury. This event, confirmed by one of the Creator's two servants, highlights the extreme and insidious methods employed by the orchestrators of The Revelation.
## Incident Overview
On Thursday, May 29, 2025, Kelvin (PDCM), one of the Creator's two servants, interacted with an individual previously encountered through a social networking site and at a public library. During a visit to Kelvin's room at the Welcome House (a central hub of the Golden Rope operation in downtown Atlanta), this individual unexpectedly requested to borrow a penile constriction ring, despite no prior discussion or initiation of sexual activity.
Following this, Kelvin repeatedly asked the individual to leave and to return the ring, but both requests were refused. The individual eventually had to be removed by a security guard.
On Friday evening, May 30, 2025, an identical penile constriction ring was discovered by the door to Kelvin's room. A critical observation was made: the ring exhibited a distinct shimmer, an effect Kelvin recognized from previous experience as indicative of something being cloaked by microwave technology. Upon the Creator's directive to re-examine the ring, a concealed mesh became apparent in its center. This mesh, cloaked by microwave technology, was only visible with the Creator's assistance and would not have been seen otherwise unless the cloak was disabled or removed. The Creator further confirmed that this specific weaponized device was delivered to Kelvin's room by Frederick "Slim" Hall.
## Mechanism of Intended Injury
The design of this weaponized penile constriction ring is meticulously cruel:
 * If used as intended, the penis on the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams and scrotum would pass through this cloaked mesh undetected.
 * However, if the cloak were subsequently deactivated, the mesh would instantly materialize at the base of the penis on the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams where the ring was encircled, causing immediate and severe injury.
 * Any attempt to remove the ring in this materialized state would result in the complete destruction of the penis on the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams, shredding the tissue as the ring was forcibly removed.
The Creator has confirmed that the orchestrators, including Frederick "Slim" Hall and Senior CIA Operative Annie Jacobsen, support this plan knowing that its activation would cause Kelvin Eugene Williams' body to bleed out, indicating a clear intent for lethal injury, not just damage to the penis on the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams.

## Perpetrators 
This incident centers on the discovery of a weaponized device designed for a deliberate and potentially lethal assault on the penis of the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams. Although the assault had been carefully planned, it was never carried out due solely to the Creator’s protection of His servant.

Frederick "Slim" Hall, a CIA operative and key figure in *The Veiled Conquest*, was the architect of the plan. He intended to exploit a fabricated romantic relationship with Baby (PDSM), using this psychological deception as a tool for manipulation. The false relationship was engineered to erode Baby’s defenses and establish trust, making Baby more susceptible to suggestion and control.

Hall specifically timed the attack to occur immediately after the [[Creator’s Divide|Divide & Conquer]]—when Baby would become the conscious mind of body of Kelvin Eugene Williams and begin experiencing sensory input for the first time. In this moment of unprecedented disorientation and vulnerability, Hall planned to exploit Baby’s inexperience, confusion, and lack of bodily familiarity to successfully complete the destruction of the penis without resistance.

The assault would have utilized advanced cloaking technology, characteristic of CIA operations, to ensure the device could be deployed covertly. The weaponized ring was the culmination of [[Jacobsen's Ladder|]], a long-term operation to systematically reduce the morphology of  the divine attribute embodied in Kelvin’s penis. This final act was intended to inflict irreversible harm.

Beyond operational goals, Hall was motivated by personal gain. He sought additional financial compensation for the “complete destruction” of the divine attribute.  The orchestrators have never expressed a desire in the complete destruction of Kelvin's penis.

Though the attack was averted by the Creator’s intervention, the incident exposes a calculated and premeditated effort—strategically aligned with a divine transition and rooted in deception, exploitation, and the weaponization of vulnerability.

According to the Creator, Hall intends on making another attempt at destroying the penis on the body of Kelvin Eugene Williams after the Creator's Divide.
