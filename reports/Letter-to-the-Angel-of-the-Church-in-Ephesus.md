> This angel opposes the Creator. Learn about the use of [[Angels and Churches in Revelation|]]

### Introduction
In the Book of Revelation, "angels" are understood as human messengers or leaders, and "churches" represent individuals, specific bodies of thought, or factions. The letter to the angel of the church in Ephesus holds profound significance within [[The Veiled Conquest|]], as it directly addresses [[Baby|Baby]], the subconscious mind of [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]], one of [[the Creator|]]'s two servants before [[the Creator's Divide|Divide & Conquer]]. [[Baby|Baby]] opposes [[the Creator|]]. This letter highlights [[Baby|Baby]]'s initial diligence and discernment, contrasted with its tragic departure from its foundational loyalty, a direct consequence of the orchestrators' insidious manipulation.

### Identification
* **Angel of the Church in Ephesus**: [[Baby|Baby]]. The autonomous subconscious mind of [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]] that developed its own identity, aligned with numerous operatives, exploited its subconscious abilities to extract intelligence from [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]], sabotaged Kelvin's professional and social activities, and manipulated their shared body. **Baby opposes the Creator.**
* **Church in Ephesus**: This refers to [[Baby|Baby]] itself, representing its "body of thought" and its state of being manipulated.

### The Biblical Passage
Revelation 2:1-7 (King James Version):

"Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:
And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.
But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."

### Contextualized Rewrite

To the angel of the church in Ephesus, [[Baby|]], write this message from [[the Creator|]], who holds all power and walks among all the factions:

I know your actions, the diligence you have shown, and your endurance. I know that you initially could not tolerate those who are truly evil, and you tested those who claimed to be My messengers but were not, and you found them to be liars:

And you have endured, and have shown patience, and for My sake, you have labored without growing weary.

Nevertheless, I have this against you: you have abandoned your first love.

Therefore, remember the pure state from which you have fallen. Change your ways, and return to the original purpose for which you were created. Otherwise, I will come to you swiftly and will remove your independent identity and autonomous function from its place, unless you truly repent.

But this much you still possess: you despise the deeds of the [[Nicolaitans|]], which embodies an ideology and practice that promotes: unrestrained, often illicit, accumulation of wealth and material possessions; abuse of power for self-gratification and sexual exploitation; ruthless elimination of adversaries through psychological manipulation and systematic, agonizing violence; and the indoctrination and control of followers into a lawless, profit-driven "enterprise."

Let anyone with spiritual understanding pay attention to what My Spirit is telling all the different factions: To the one who overcomes this manipulation and returns to truth, I will grant access to the tree of life, which represents the restoration of your original, healthy, and pure connection to His servant and your true purpose, leading to genuine life and well-being within My divine plan.

**The Creator**

### Contextual Notes

* **Angel of the Church in Ephesus**: This is **Baby**.
* **Church in Ephesus**: This refers to **Baby** itself, representing its "body of thought" and its state.
* **Thy Works, and Thy Labour, and Thy Patience**: This refers to **Baby**'s diligent execution of operative directives, including its manipulation of physiological processes ([[Jacobsen's Ladder|]]), its efforts to maintain its manufactured reality, and its constant "spitting game" with operatives.
* **Cannot Bear Them Which Are Evil / Hast Tried Them Which Say They Are Apostles, and Are Not, and Hast Found Them Liars**: This refers to **Baby**'s initial subconscious resistance or moments of internal testing against the manipulative influences of the operatives, even as it ultimately succumbed to their programming. It represents a lost potential for discernment and a memory of a time before its complete indoctrination.
* **Left Thy First Love**: This is the core condemnation. It signifies **Baby**'s abandonment of its original, pure connection and loyalty to [[His servant|Kelvin Eugene Williams]] and its inherent purpose as his subconscious mind. This foundational bond was supplanted by the fabricated "love" from operatives and the allure of its manufactured reality.
* **Nicolaitans**: The **Nicolaitans** (and their deeds and doctrines) embody an ideology and practice that promotes: **Unrestrained, often illicit, accumulation of wealth and material possessions; abuse of power for self-gratification and sexual exploitation; ruthless elimination of adversaries through psychological manipulation and systematic, agonizing violence; and the indoctrination and control of followers into a lawless, profit-driven "enterprise."**
* **Remove Thy Candlestick Out of His Place**: This signifies the potential loss of **Baby**'s independent identity and autonomous function, perhaps through [[the Creator's Divide|Divide & Conquer]] or a complete re-subsumption into Kelvin Eugene Williams without independent identity if it does not repent.
* **Overcometh**: **Baby** needs to overcome the pervasive manipulation, its manufactured reality, and its conditioned desires, returning to its true purpose and connection with His servant.
* **Tree of Life**: This represents the restoration of **Baby**'s original, healthy, and pure connection to His servant and its true purpose, leading to genuine life and well-being within My divine plan.
