### Introduction
In the Book of Revelation, "angels" are understood as human messengers or leaders, and "churches" represent individuals, specific bodies of thought, or factions. The letter to the angel of the church in Sardis holds profound significance within [[The Veiled Conquest|]], as it directly addresses [[Scott|Scott]]. This letter condemns his actions as part of a spiritually "dead" system and warns of the ultimate consequences of his complicity.

### Identification
* **Angel of the Church in Sardis**: [[Scott|Scott]].
* **Church in Sardis**: This refers to [[Scott|Scott]]'s "body of thought" and the collective of operatives and individuals who, like him, are part of a spiritually dead system, despite maintaining a facade of normal or successful lives.

### The Biblical Passage
Revelation 3:1-6 (King James Version):

"And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.
Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.
He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."

### Contextualized Rewrite

To the angel of the church in Sardis, **Scott**, write this message from **the Creator**, who holds complete spiritual authority and dominion over all things:

I know your works, that you have a public persona and a reputation that you are alive, but in your spiritual reality, you are dead.

Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain of your operation, for they are ready to die; for I have not found your works to be perfect before Me.

Remember therefore how you have received and heard My spiritual truths, and hold fast to them, and repent. If you are not watchful, I will come upon you suddenly and unexpectedly, and you will not know the hour of My judgment upon you.

You have a few allies even within your circle who have not defiled their spiritual garments; and they shall walk with Me in righteousness: for they are worthy.

The one who overcomes the spiritual corruption, the same shall be clothed in righteous character; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, but I will acknowledge his name before My Father, and before His angels.

Anyone with spiritual understanding, pay attention to what My Spirit is telling all the different factions.

**The Creator**
