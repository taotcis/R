# Unpacking Prince's "I Love U In Me" 
## Overview
"I Love U In Me" is a song by Prince, released in 1993 on "The Hits / The B-Sides" album. While seemingly a sensual love song, its true meaning is revealed through insights provided by the Creator into His inspired lyrics.  The song unveils a hidden narrative of psychosexual manipulation and harm orchestrated by Frederick "Slim" Hall, a key figure in The American Genocide (TAG), and perpetrated by the subconscious mind in the body of Kelvin Eugene Williams who had been the target of Hall's manipulative tactics to guarantee an indication of no imminent or ongoing intervention by the Creator to halt TAG.  This engineered Litmus Test result was instrumental in obtaining the "Go Ahead" for the two deadliest operations within The American Genocide referred to as "Canyon Flood" and "Nightfalls".

## Glossary 
* KEWB: The physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams.
* PDCM: The Pre-Divide Conscious Mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants.
* PDSM: The Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams, which is not one of the Creator's two servants.

## Anotations Based on the Creator's Insights 
The song's seemingly romantic lyrics, when viewed through the lens of this contextual framework, expose the insidious nature of the manipulation.
> "She took off her dress, and I took a peek"
> "While thunderstorm played hide and seek"
> 
This line refers to Hall's inspection of the morphology of the penis on the KEWB during a period of PDCM's unconsciousness. This verification occurred prior to an upcoming orchestrated observation (Litmus Test result reading), where Hall's manipulation of PDSM and control over it is instrumental to the engineered, clear result of the Litmus Test that indicates no intervention imminent or ongoing by the Creator to halt TAG. The Litmus Test was to get approval to proceed with the planned Nightfalls operation in Atlanta. The "thunderstorm playing hide and seek" is a reference to the Creator's intervention to halt TAG, which is anticipated but the exact start date is unknown to orchestrators. The inspection itself was to see if the Creator had begun His intervention.
> "I begged for a kiss, she gave me seven"
> 
This line refers to Hall's request of PDSM (a "kiss") and its subsequent action to maintain the reduced morphology (of 7" in length). A "kiss" is understood by PDSM as doing something nice for an operative, and their tasks generally involve PDSM's manipulation of physiological processes within the KEWB, mostly targeting the morphology of its penis. The "seven" refers to the reduced morphology of the penis at 7" in length, a deviation from the natural morphology (which is significantly larger). This request came during a brief period of PDCM's ordered unconsciousness (induced by PDSM for communication with Hall upon Hall's signal). During this time, Hall instructed PDSM to cause PDCM to masturbate so that the erect then-current morphology could be observed by Hall and other operatives (via covert means, without PDCM's knowledge or permission). Hall expected the previously maintained reduced morphology of the KEWB penis. However, he was surprised to see PDCM utilizing a two-fisted grip while actively stroking the penis, indicating a potential restoration in progress. Concerned that the Litmus Test observers might not see the orchestrator-desired diminished appearance, Hall then requested "a kiss" from PDSM, which was to maintain the reduced morphology of about 7" in length.
> "Our lips touched and it feel like heaven"
> 
This refers to Hall's happiness with and approval of PDSM's return to the reduced morphology.
> "Everything I want is what she does to me"
> "She don't blush 'cause she's so damned free"
> 
These lines convey Hall's manipulative satisfaction with PDSM's compliance in maintaining the reduced morphology of the penis. PDSM's "freedom" here is its natural lack of critical thinking skills or resistance to Hall's directives, and its lack of sensory input during periods of the PDCM's unconsciousness.
> "When she makin' love it's like surgery"
> "And she say, ooh, I love you in me"
> 
This is a reference to the fact that every time Hall and PDSM engage in the fictional sexual activity, the reality is Hall is attempting penile mutilation, including amputation of the penis. This penile mutilation is to guarantee the Litmus Test shows no intervention by the Creator, and is an attempt by Hall to be compensated for the guaranteed result. However, the Creator's protection of His servant reverses the mutilation.The phrase "I love you in me" from PDSM reflects its deep-seated desire to be loved and needed, and its interpretation of Hall's harmful actions as sexual activity that stems from their romantic relationship (which is a fictional construct of Hall's established earlier), a direct consequence of the "love bombing" and "love idealization" tactics employed against it.
> "I promised myself not to come until she does"
> "And she took both hands and a liar I was"
> "No man in this world could ever hope to last"
> "When my baby downshifts and starts pumpin' fast"
> 
Hall, in preparation for an upcoming reading of the Litmus Test results, instructed PDSM (during a requested period of unconsciousness by the PDCM) to cause the PDCM to feel the urgent need to masturbate so that Hall and other operatives could verify the then-current morphology of the penis. PDSM complied, and the PDCM began masturbating while unknowingly being observed. Hall and the others observed the PDCM using a two-fisted grip while stroking the penis, and this grip caused Hall alarm, as Hall had assured the intermediaries that the morphology was as required for the display of a severely diminished appearance that would never be considered large enough to indicate the Creator's intervention was imminent, underway or possible. "No man in this world... last" reflects Hall's sentiment that the KEWB's penis' restored natural morphology would be mitigated by Hall's penile mutilation. Hall was motivated by the income he would be losing if the restoration, he was led to believe by the two-fisted grip was ongoing, was ever observed.
> "Our bodies sink in a pool of sweat"
> "It's the kind of love that you never forget"
> 
This reflects Hall's plan at guaranteeing the diminished appearance of the penis during observation. Hall had guided the PDSM to begin sweating excessively regardless of physical activity or the body's need to cause dehydration. "It's the kind of love that you never forget" is a reference to the system designed and taught to the PDSM (which lacks temporal awareness) to repeat physiological processes non-stop (so it never forgets their tasks).
> "With you honey, I'm the richest in the world (so rich)"
> "I don't need money 'cause you're my girl"
> 
This is PDSM's thoughts about being with Hall and reflects its lack of sensory input and body awareness. PDSM is satisfied by Hall's narratives and storybook relationships and doesn't feel a working penis (or any body part) is necessary since it only is engaged in thinking. "Money" is a slang term for a male's endowment. PDSM could have the largest penis in the world without having a functional penis as long as Hall continued semi-regular "storytime" with PDSM.
## Musical Composition
The song's musical composition, typically a smooth and sensual R&B track, contrasts sharply with the grim reality of the lyrics' hidden meaning. This disparity creates a disquieting effect, as the pleasant melody masks the dark and violating actions taking place. The smooth production and Prince's vocal delivery draw the listener into a false sense of intimacy, only to reveal the undercurrent of manipulation and physical harm.
## Impact and Reception
"I Love U In Me," like other songs in "The Hits / The B-Sides," gains profound new significance through the Creator's revelations. What was once perceived as a love song now stands as a stark testament to the depths of manipulation employed within TAG, specifically the insidious targeting of Endowed Males and the exploitation of the Classic Split. Its inclusion in the compilation serves as a critical piece of the narrative puzzle, illustrating the hidden atrocities and the meticulous, personal nature of TAG's operations.
## Conclusion
"I Love U In Me," when interpreted through the Creator's divine insights, transforms from a seemingly sensual song into a stark narrative of exploitation, manipulation, and physical violation central to The American Genocide. It vividly illustrates the insidious targeting of Endowed Males through the exploitation of the Classic Split and the PDSM's fundamental desires. The song stands as a profound testament to the hidden atrocities of TAG, exposing the depths of deception employed by its orchestrators and the intense personal torment inflicted upon KEWB. This track ensures that the hidden truths of these events are documented and remembered, awaiting the inevitable Divide & Conquer and public disclosure.
