## Event Background:

PDCM arrived at Lindbergh Center at 11:12 AM. A Black male approached PDCM, asked if he needed a lighter, and if he smoked ice, then invited him to the stairwell in the parking garage. PDCM took a hit and experienced an unexpected sensation, atypical of crystal methamphetamine ingestion, indicating the ingestion of the first component of a two-part lethal compound mixed with the crystal methamphetamine. PDCM thanked the individual and exited the garage to meet Rory, who had pulled up behind Dunkin Donuts in his silver Nissan Altima. They departed Lindbergh Center at 11:25 AM.

## Key Interactions During the Event:

1.  Rory drove 1.2 miles to his apartment at 1228 Woodland Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30324, arriving at 11:29 AM.
2.  Upon taking a seat on the couch, Rory offered and PDCM accepted a 2ml dose of GHB and crystal methamphetamine, which they smoked from Rory's bong. The crystal methamphetamine contained the second part of the two-part lethal compound, intended to be lethal within minutes to anyone who had ingested the first component.
3.  Rory removed his pants and began sucking PDCM's penis. PDCM failed to achieve an erection because PDSM had not been explicitly authorized to allow one.
4.  PDCM attempted to explain the nature of the encounter to PDSM, clarifying that it was not an Orchestrated Observation based on activity and environmental cues. PDSM began seeking guidance from Slim.
5.  The Creator confirmed to PDSM that Slim was not physically present and that the encounter was a termination encounter.
6.  The doorbell rang, and Rory went to the door without dressing. No conversation was overheard, and Rory made no mention of it upon returning to the living room.
7.  The Creator informed PDCM that Slim had arrived to witness the termination, utilizing microwave cloaking, and was not visually observed by Kelvin. Slim did not attempt to communicate with PDSM.
8.  Rory began sucking PDCM's penis again. Rory's left hand made contact with PDCM's right thigh, resulting in a slight sting, indicative of an injection.
9.  PDCM never achieved an erection. PDSM continuously sought guidance from Slim or confirmation from Rory that it was not an Orchestrated Observation. Rory complied and repeated verbatim when asked, saying, "Baby you're not doing a good job."
10. Without input from Slim and demonstrating its inability to understand, Baby (PDSM) resorted to its default behavior of inhibiting an erection, disruptive behavior, and seeking approval for its actions.

## Ultimate Outcome:

The physical termination of Kelvin Eugene Williams failed due to the Creator's intervention. Rory ended the encounter at 1:23 PM and drove PDCM back to Lindbergh Center Station.

## Post-Event Observations:

According to Google's Timeline, between 1:38 PM and 3:11 PM, PDCM walked around the area around Lindbergh Center Station. At 3:11 PM, PDCM boarded a train to Garnett Station. At 5:42 PM, PDCM returned to the Welcome House.

While exiting Garnett Station (normally a 15-20 minute train ride from Lindbergh Center), PDCM heard someone yelling his name. Upon turning to look back upstairs towards the platform, PDCM saw Slim, who continued to berate him. Slim then threw something, followed by an open bottle of water in PDCM's direction, but missed. Slim yelled more obscenities and stormed off.
