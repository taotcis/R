At the foundation of the revelations contained in this wiki stands the **Creator**, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. **He** is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great “I Am.” These titles emphasize **His** role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The **Creator** is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. **His** attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. **His** two servants neutrally refer to **Him** as the **Creator**, in accordance with **His** directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.
