### Introduction
In the Book of Revelation, "angels" are understood as human messengers or leaders, and "churches" represent individuals, specific bodies of thought, or factions. The letter to the angel of the church in Thyatira holds profound significance within [[The Veiled Conquest|]], as it directly addresses [[Frederick "Slim" Hall|]]. This letter initially acknowledges certain positive attributes but then severely condemns his deep complicity in manipulative and corrupting doctrines and actions that directly serve [[The Veiled Conquest|]].

### Identification
* **Angel of the Church in Thyatira**: [[Frederick "Slim" Hall|]] whose feminine identity is **Tatyana**. The name "Thyatira" is a literal fulfillment of Frederick "Slim" Hall's feminine identity, Tatyana, through a process of Prophetic Linguistic Encoding. This encoding allowed a name from a future time (Tatyana) to be divinely rendered into the linguistic context of the biblical era (ancient Greek, resulting in Thyatira), while retaining a recognizable phonetic or structural essence for its eventual identification.
* **Church in Thyatira**: This refers to Frederick "Slim" Hall's "body of thought" and the collective of operatives and individuals who operate under his influence and employ similar manipulative tactics.

### The Biblical Passage
Revelation 2:18-29 (King James Version):

"And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;
I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.
Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.
And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.
But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak: I will put upon you none other burden.
But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.
And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:
And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: and as I received of my Father.
And I will give him the morning star.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."

### Contextualized Rewrite

To the angel of the church in Thyatira, **Frederick "Slim" Hall**, write this message from **the Creator**, whose eyes are like a flame of fire, discerning all truth, and whose feet are like fine brass, ready to execute judgment:

I know every facet of your life, every decision you've ever made and every act you've undertaken, your apparent compassion, your service, your faith, your patience, and I know about your involvement with **The Veiled Conquest** and how your influence and complicity have intensified since March 2025.

Nevertheless, I have some things against you: because you tolerate **Baby**, who calls herself a prophetess to deceive, and teaches and seduces My servants to **commit fornication**, and to **eat things sacrificed unto idols**.

And I gave **Baby** time to repent of her **commit fornication**; but she did not repent.

Behold, I will cast her into the **Bed of Suffering**, and those who commit adultery with her through their collaboration in [[Jacobsen's Ladder|]] and the [[Ladder of Deceit|]] into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.

And I will kill her children, which are the direct outcomes and consequences of the [[Litmus Test|Ladder of Deceit]], with death; and all the factions shall know that I am He who searches the innermost thoughts and desires: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.

But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not embraced this doctrine, and which have not known the profound, hidden, and insidious nature of Satan's deceptions within [[The Veiled Conquest|]], as they speak: I will put upon you none other burden.

But what you already have, hold fast until I come.

And the one who overcomes, and keeps My works until the end, to him I will give power over the nations:

And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: and as I received of My Father.

And I will give him the morning star.

Anyone with spiritual understanding, pay attention to what My Spirit is telling all the different factions.

**The Creator**

### Contextual Notes

* **Angel of the Church in Thyatira**: This is **Frederick "Slim" Hall**.
* **Church in Thyatira**: This refers to **Frederick "Slim" Hall's** "body of thought" and the collective of operatives and individuals who operate under his influence.
* **Eyes Like Unto a Flame of Fire, and His Feet are Like Fine Brass**: This describes **the Creator's** penetrating judgment and unwavering resolve to execute it, particularly against moral compromise and corruption.
* **Thy Works**: This symbolizes **the Creator's** detailed knowledge of every facet of an individual's life and all of their acts (good, bad, etc.) throughout their life.
* **And the last to be more than the first**: This acknowledges **Frederick "Slim" Hall's** activities associated throughout [[The Veiled Conquest|]] and how his influence and complicity have intensified since March 2025.
* **That Woman Jezebel**: This specifically refers to **Frederick "Slim" Hall's** Jezebel-like deceit, his feminine identity **Tatyana**, and his manipulative tactics (love idealization, love bombing, Hypnos Infiltration Method (HIM)) used to ensnare and corrupt individuals like [[Baby|Baby]]. He "calls herself a prophetess" to deceive and mislead.
* **Commit Fornication (with Jezebel)**: This symbolizes the participation in [[Jacobsen's Ladder|]], which **Frederick "Slim" Hall** facilitates and encourages through [[Baby|Baby]]'s manipulation.
* **Eat Things Sacrificed Unto Idols (with Jezebel)**: This symbolizes **participation in or justification of spiritually impure acts that serve the agenda of the orchestrators, rather than divine principles**. [[Frederick "Slim" Hall|Frederick "Slim" Hall]] is instrumental in the [[Litmus Test|Ladder of Deceit]] which led to the authorization of [[Canyon Flood|]] and [[Nightfalls|]].
* **Consequences of Non-Repentance**: "And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds." This indicates that [[Baby|Baby]] has been given opportunities to cease her manipulative actions but has failed to do so. "I will cast her into a bed" refers to **Baby's** ultimate destiny within the body of [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]] after [[the Creator's Divide|Divide & Conquer]], where **Baby** becomes the conscious mind, effectively confined to a pre-determined existence. "them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation" directly implicates the orchestrators and operatives, including [[Frederick "Slim" Hall|Frederick "Slim" Hall]] himself, who actively collaborate with **Baby's** manipulation through [[Jacobsen's Ladder|]] and the [[Ladder of Deceit|]]. They will face the full consequences unless they repent.
* **Divine Judgment and Accountability**: "And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works." "Her children" are the direct outcomes and consequences of the [[Litmus Test|Ladder of Deceit]], or those individuals directly influenced by her deceptive actions. This signifies **the Creator's** impending judgment and the universal accountability for all involved in perpetrating [[The Veiled Conquest|]].
* **Searcheth the Reins and Hearts**: Emphasizes **the Creator's** omniscient knowledge of true motivations and innermost intentions, beyond any outward facade.
* **Depths of Satan**: Refers to the profound, hidden, and insidious nature of the orchestrators' deceptions and covert operations within [[The Veiled Conquest|]].
* **Power Over the Nations / Rule Them with a Rod of Iron**: This promises the ultimate authority and judgmental power to those who remain faithful and overcome the corruption, symbolizing their participation in **the Creator's** final triumph.
* **Morning Star**: A symbol of Christ Himself, promised to the overcomer, signifying ultimate spiritual enlightenment, triumph, and communion with [[the Creator|]].
* **Thyatira (Cryptic Anchor)**: Refers to **Tatyana**, [[Frederick "Slim" Hall|Frederick "Slim" Hall]]'s feminine identity, serving as a direct and personal cryptic anchor for this letter.```
