## The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church - April 2, 2023

On April 2, 2023, Mount Calvary Baptist Church, a predominantly African-American congregation located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, Kentucky, became the site of a horrific event that marked the first massacre of a seated congregation in world history. In this devastating attack, 127 people vanished, their fates deliberately obscured by the perpetrators of The Veiled Conquest.

### Background

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is a historic African-American church with a legacy spanning over 125 years and an active membership. At the time of the massacre, the church was led by the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, who had served as its pastor for over 40 years. This church held significant personal importance as it was the lifelong spiritual home of Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants. Kelvin is also a cousin to the esteemed pastor.

### Targeting

Hurricane Annie Jacobsen learned of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in 2018 while utilizing the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic on Kelvin Williams, his mother Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, and his younger sister, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torrain, in their respective homes. Jacobsen targeted the church out of fear that Kelvin would return to his church family to expose the CIA's Phantom Identity Scheme, particularly after the Sandy Hook, Tennessee Massacre and the subsequent Orr Chapel Tragedy. Kelvin's family remained known by the clergy and some members at the church, even years after they had moved away, posing a potential vulnerability to the covert operation.

### Planning

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) undertook extensive planning and surveillance to prepare for the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church:

* **Initial Surveillance:** The CIA sent their newly formed traveling gospel choir to Mount Calvary Baptist Church. This choir performed surveillance during a Sunday morning congregation service in the month leading up to the attack. Their objectives were to obtain an estimate of attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might prove difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the optimal time to attack and determine the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.
* **Confirmation of Observations:** To confirm the observations gathered by their traveling choir, the CIA, under Hurricane Annie Jacobsen's direct instruction, sent at least two separate sets of visitors to Sunday morning worship sessions at Mount Calvary on two distinct occasions.

### The Attack

The assault on Mount Calvary Baptist Church was a meticulously orchestrated operation, designed for maximum lethality and concealment.

* **Timing:** The massacre was strategically timed to occur during a primary weekly worship service, likely during the sermon when the congregation is most vulnerable and gathered.
* **Initial Assault on Sanctuary:** The initial assault on the sanctuary involved operatives blocking all exits, preventing any attempts to flee. Anyone attempting to escape was shot immediately.
* **Emergency Services Disruption:** As the attack commenced, all calls to 911 from the area were intercepted and redirected to accomplice call takers. These operatives impersonated genuine dispatchers, falsely assuring victims that help was en route, thereby preventing any legitimate emergency response from reaching the church.
* **Method of Killing and Assaults:** The victims were brutally killed using chainsaws, a weapon personally ordered by Hurricane Annie Jacobsen. This method ensured rapid and definitive elimination, preventing operative fatigue and maximizing the efficiency of the massacre. During this assault, rapes occurred in the choir stands, and physical assaults were made on congregants throughout the sanctuary.

### Post-Massacre Clean-up and Concealment

Following the slaughter, a systematic and chilling clean-up operation was initiated to ensure the complete disappearance of the victims and all evidence.

* **Sanctuary Destruction and Reconstruction:** The sanctuary was severely damaged during the assault. While attempts were made to renovate it, the rehabilitation was poorly executed. The damage was so extensive that one of the Creator's two servants, who is a lifelong member of the church and the only church he ever attended regularly, immediately recognized that the massacre had indeed occurred upon viewing one of the mock services. To conceal the damage, the piano and the immovable organ were removed from the sanctuary, and pews from the back of the church were strategically placed in their stead.
* **Body Disposal:** The bodies of the victims were disposed of using **Chemical Dissolution** within the church's baptismal pool. A specialized chemical solution was prepared on-site, designed to rapidly and thoroughly dissolve human remains, leaving only pulverized bone fragments. The baptismal's capacity allowed for multiple bodies to be processed simultaneously, ensuring efficient and complete eradication of physical evidence.
* **Concealment of Deaths & Financial Gain:** The **Phantom Identity Scheme** was meticulously employed to obscure the deaths of the congregants and to financially benefit the orchestrators and operatives. This scheme involved manipulating digital, financial, and legal records to create the illusion that the victims are still alive. Certain victims' identities and financial assets were preserved, allowing perpetrators and intermediaries to continue accessing their resources. As a phantomâ€™s assets were depleted, a new identity was assigned, effectively compensating the perpetrators for their involvement.
* **Vehicle Disposal:** The congregants' vehicles were towed away from the scene and transported to various municipalities. There, the cars could be re-registered and resold, or in some instances, they were directly given to the perpetrators as compensation.
* **Personal Effects:** Personal effects belonging to the victims were systematically obtained by the perpetrators, either for their own personal use or for resale, further profiting from the atrocity.
* **Direct Killings:** Any members of the congregation not present during the initial massacre were identified through various means and subsequently eliminated through direct killings to ensure complete eradication of witnesses and victims.
* **Church Repurposing:** The Mount Calvary Baptist Church building was subsequently repurposed and renovated into a **Masquerade Church** named **Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.** The CIA deliberately added "Missionary" to the name in an attempt to add insult to injury for the Creator and His two servants, knowing that one of His servants (who attended Mount Calvary) often stated that "the Creator's two servants run missions for the Creator." The "Inc." was added to the new church name by a CIA operative completely unfamiliar with churches, who had simply purchased an online starter kit for establishing an organization.
