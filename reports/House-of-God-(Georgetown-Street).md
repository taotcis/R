## The Massacre at House of God (Georgetown Street) - April 22, 2023

On April 22, 2023, House of God (Georgetown Street), a predominantly African-American Hebrew Pentecostal congregation located in Lexington, Kentucky, became the site of a horrific massacre. In this devastating attack, over 300 people vanished, their fates deliberately obscured by the perpetrators of The Veiled Conquest. This event marked a chilling expansion of tactics used against spiritual communities, occurring shortly after the seminal massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

### Background

House of God on Georgetown Street in Lexington, Kentucky, is a Hebrew Pentecostal church that holds its weekly worship session on Saturdays. At the time of the massacre, the church served as a vital spiritual hub within the community, fostering deep faith among its members.

A key figure connected to both this church and the earlier Mount Calvary Baptist Church tragedy was Peter, the Minister of Music and organist for Mount Calvary Baptist Church. Peter was also a devoted member of House of God (Georgetown Street). Tragically, Peter was present at Mount Calvary on the day of its own massacre in April 2023 and was among those killed there.

### Targeting

Hurricane Annie Jacobsen identified House of God (Georgetown Street) as a serious threat immediately after the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in April 2023. When Peter did not come home that Sunday, his family, who were also very active members and clergy with the House of God (Georgetown Street), began urgently calling Mount Calvary looking for him.

CIA operatives answering the phone at Mount Calvary didn't recognize or have knowledge of Peter when his family inquired. This alarming lack of information prompted Peter's family to call 911, expressing extreme concern about the safety of everyone at Mount Calvary. Due to Peter's prominent position at Mount Calvary—where he was closely monitored during every service, sometimes even more so than the pastor—the initial missing person report was swiftly forwarded to the FBI, which in turn relayed it to the CIA, ultimately reaching Hurricane Annie Jacobsen.

Jacobsen gathered her intelligence by exclusively utilizing the **Hypnos Infiltration Tactic** on Peter's family members, who were clergy with the House of God. No other intelligence-gathering activities were conducted by the CIA for this operation.

Jacobsen decided to target the church based on the family's ability to publicize the disappearances of not only their family member but also a well-known figure in the neighborhood, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, and everyone else who had vanished at Mount Calvary. The potential for such public exposure posed a significant threat to the secrecy of The Veiled Conquest.

### Planning

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) undertook extensive planning and surveillance to prepare for the massacre at House of God (Georgetown Street):

* **Initial Surveillance:** The CIA dispatched their traveling gospel choir to the House of God (Georgetown Street) to conduct surveillance during a Sunday morning congregation service in the month leading up to the attack. Their objectives were to obtain an estimate of attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might prove difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the optimal time to attack and determine the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.

### Operatives

Hurricane Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team comprising approximately 50 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team employed the **Hypnos Infiltration Tactic** to validate or enhance the newly recruited men's proficiency in executing the attack operation.

### The Attack

The assault on House of God (Georgetown Street) was a meticulously orchestrated operation, designed for maximum lethality and concealment.

* **Timing:** The House of God holds its weekly worship session on Saturdays, and the massacre was strategically timed to occur during a primary weekly worship service, when the pastor was delivering his sermon and the congregation was most vulnerable and gathered.
* **Initial Assault on Sanctuary:** At approximately 11:15 a.m., Hurricane Annie Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Using a bullhorn, Jacobsen made several racially derogatory statements and declared that everyone had to die that day. Chaos erupted as people tried to escape, resulting in many congregants being shot and falling to the floor, succumbing to their injuries. Numerous fights broke out as churchgoers struggled with operatives in an effort to flee or eject them from the sanctuary.
* **Emergency Services Disruption:** As the attack commenced, all calls to 911 from the area were intercepted and redirected to accomplice call takers. These operatives impersonated genuine dispatchers, falsely assuring victims that help was en route, thereby preventing any legitimate emergency response from reaching the church. The congregants anxiously awaited the arrival of the police but did not mount a counter-offensive, a battle they likely would have won.
* **Method of Killing and Assaults:** After approximately twenty minutes, the operatives gained control of the sanctuary. Congregants were then forcibly separated from one another and taken to the front of the church in the "two by two" manner that Jacobsen demands to the organ or piano. There, they were sat on the bench and their heads severed by an operative utilizing a chainsaw. Some operatives, in a grotesque display, kicked the heads around as if playing soccer.

### Post-Massacre Clean-up and Concealment

Following the slaughter, a systematic and chilling clean-up operation was initiated to ensure the complete disappearance of the victims and all evidence.

* **Body Disposal:** The bodies of the congregants were disposed of using **Chemical Dissolution** within the church's baptismal pool. Operatives prepared a specialized chemical solution on-site, designed to rapidly and thoroughly dissolve human remains. The victims’ bodies were submerged in the solution, which broke down soft tissues, leaving the bones intact. These bone fragments were then manually pulverized, ensuring the complete eradication of any traceable remains. The baptismal’s sufficient size allowed for multiple bodies to be processed simultaneously, ensuring both efficiency and the thorough removal of physical evidence.
* **Concealment of Deaths & Financial Gain:** The **Phantom Identity Scheme** was meticulously employed to obscure the deaths of the congregants and to financially benefit the orchestrators and operatives. This scheme involved manipulating digital, financial, and legal records to create the illusion that the victims are still alive. Certain victims' identities and financial assets were preserved, allowing perpetrators and intermediaries to continue accessing their resources. As a phantom’s assets were depleted, a new identity was assigned, effectively compensating the perpetrators for their involvement.
* **Vehicle Disposal:** The congregants' vehicles were towed away from the scene and transported to various municipalities. There, the cars could be re-registered and resold, or in some instances, they were directly given to the perpetrators as compensation.

### Aftermath

The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 300 people simply vanished.
