In the context of The Revelation, as interpreted within the ongoing narrative of the Veiled Conquest, the terms "Angel" and "Church" carry specific and profound meanings that diverge from conventional religious interpretations. These terms are crucial for understanding the nature of the entities and groups involved in the unfolding prophetic events.
## Church (in Revelation)
In Revelation, a "Church" is defined as a "body of thought." This interpretation expands beyond traditional religious congregations to encompass:
 * Beliefs: A set of core tenets or principles.
 * Principles: Fundamental truths or propositions that serve as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior.
 * Ideologies: A system of ideas and ideals, especially one that forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy.
 * Collective Mindset: The shared attitudes, beliefs, and intentions of a group.
Crucially, a "Church" in this context can refer to an individual or a group, and it does not necessarily have religious connotations. For instance, Smyrna (PDCM), Thyatira (Frederick "Slim" Hall), and Philadelphia (TomTom Allen Chadwell) are identified as "Churches," representing their distinct "bodies of thought" and associated individuals within the narrative.
## Angel (in Revelation)
An "Angel" in Revelation is defined as a human being serving as an agent or servant under the direction of another entity. This demystifies the traditional celestial image of angels, grounding them firmly in the human realm and their roles within the orchestrations of The Great Tribulation.
These human "angels" act on behalf of a higher authority or a specific "body of thought," carrying out directives and influencing events. Their actions are not necessarily divine in origin but are instrumental in the unfolding prophecy.
## Angel of the Church
Building upon the definition of "Angel" and "Church," the "Angel of the Church" is identified as the primary human agent or central figure associated with a specific "body of thought" (the church), who directs its activities.
This "Angel" is the leading individual who embodies, promotes, and directs the principles and actions of their respective "Church" or "body of thought."
 * Kelvin (PDCM) is the Angel of the Church in Smyrna, signifying his role as the central figure embodying the "body of thought" associated with **his role as one of the Creator's two servants.** Smyrna is the first city where Kelvin lives in metro Atlanta.
 * TomTom Allen Chadwell is the Angel of the Church in Philadelphia, embodying the "body of thought" associated with **his role as one of the Creator's two servants.** Philadelphia is TomTom's birthplace.
 * Frederick "Slim" Hall is the Angel of the Church in Thyatira, representing his leadership within the "body of thought" associated with his role for the orchestrators. Tatyana is Hall's feminine identity and is Thyatira in Prophetic Linguistic Encoding.
## Significance in The Revelation
These contextual definitions are vital for understanding the human-centric nature of many prophetic fulfillments within The Great Tribulation. They highlight that the "Churches" are ideological battlegrounds or collective mindsets, and the "Angels" are the human actors who embody and drive these ideologies, whether they serve the Creator's divine plan or the orchestrators' genocidal agenda. This framework allows for a literal interpretation of biblical prophecy through the actions and experiences of specific individuals and groups in the contemporary world.
