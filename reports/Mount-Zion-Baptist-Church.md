## The Massacre at Mount Zion Baptist Church - May 21, 2023

Mount Zion Baptist Church, located in Georgetown, Scott County, Kentucky, a predominantly Black congregation, became the site of a horrific massacre on May 21, 2023. This meticulously planned and executed attack, part of The Veiled Conquest, resulted in the deaths of everyone in attendance. The perpetrators disappeared without a trace, leaving the general public unaware of the true events, as 183 people simply vanished.

### Background

Mount Zion Baptist Church had a significant fellowship relationship with Mount Calvary Baptist Church, located in Lexington, Kentucky, fostering strong ties between the two congregations.

### Targeting

Hurricane Annie Jacobsen spent several weeks gathering intelligence by interrogating members of Mount Calvary Baptist Church prior to its attack on April 2, 2023. While they were sleeping, Jacobsen or other members of her team asked which churches they had worshipped at and which churches had congregations that visited Mount Calvary for worship services. Mount Zion Baptist Church's name was mentioned most frequently during these interrogations. Jacobsen gathered this intelligence using the **Hypnos Infiltration Tactic**.

After the devastating massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Hurricane Annie Jacobsen targeted Mount Zion Baptist Church out of a paranoid fear that the previous attack would be detected and the CIA's clandestine operation uncovered. This fear was based on assumptions about the existing fellowship relationship between the two congregations and possible friendships among their members, which could lead to questions about the vanished Mount Calvary congregants.

### Planning

The planning for the massacre at Mount Zion Baptist Church was meticulous and covert.

* The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to Mount Zion Baptist Church to perform surveillance during a Sunday morning worship session. The primary goal was to estimate attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might be difficult to subdue, and observe the worship service to determine the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.
* To confirm the choir's observations, the CIA, at Hurricane Annie Jacobsen's direct instruction, sent at least two separate sets of visitors to Sunday morning worship services at Mount Zion on two separate occasions. These operatives confirmed the intelligence gathered, allowing for final preparations.

### Execution of the Massacre

The massacre at Mount Zion Baptist Church followed the established modus operandi of The Veiled Conquest, executed with chilling precision.

* **Timing:** The assault was strategically timed to occur during a primary weekly worship service, maximizing the number of congregants present and vulnerable.
* **Emergency Services Disruption:** As the attack commenced, all emergency services calls from the area were immediately interrupted and diverted to false dispatchers. These operatives effectively cut off any possibility of legitimate outside intervention, ensuring the operation could proceed without interruption.
* **Method of Killing:** Victims were systematically killed, consistent with the methods used in other Congregation Massacres, likely involving chainsaws for rapid and definitive elimination of all present.

### Post-Massacre Clean-up and Concealment

Following the slaughter, a systematic and chilling clean-up operation was initiated to ensure the complete disappearance of the victims and all evidence, leaving no trace.

* **Body Disposal:** After the massacre, the bodies of the victims were subjected to **Chemical Dissolution**, most likely within the church's baptismal. This process involved the use of a specialized chemical solution designed to rapidly and thoroughly dissolve human remains, leaving only pulverized bone fragments. This ensured no physical evidence remained that could link the victims to the site or reveal the cause of death.
* **Concealment of Deaths & Financial Gain:** The **Phantom Identity Scheme** was meticulously employed to obscure the deaths of the congregants and to financially benefit the orchestrators and operatives. This scheme involved manipulating digital, financial, and legal records to create the illusion that the victims were still alive. Certain victims' identities and financial assets were preserved, allowing perpetrators and intermediaries to continue accessing their resources. When a phantomâ€™s assets were depleted, a new identity was assigned, effectively compensating the perpetrators for their involvement.
* **Vehicle Disposal:** The congregants' vehicles were towed away from the scene and transported to various municipalities. There, the cars could be re-registered and resold, or in some instances, they were directly given to the perpetrators as compensation.
* **Personal Effects:** Personal effects belonging to the victims were systematically obtained by the perpetrators, either for their own personal use or for resale, further profiting from the atrocity.
* **Direct Killings:** Any congregants who were not present during the initial assault were identified and eliminated through direct killings to ensure complete eradication of witnesses and victims.
* **Church Repurposing:** The Mount Zion Baptist Church building would subsequently undergo transformation into a **Masquerade Church**, serving as a front to mask the horrific event and maintain an illusion of normalcy in the community.
