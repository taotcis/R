# "The Hits / The B-Sides" – A Divine Testament through Artistic Expression

“The Hits / The B-Sides” (1993) is far more than a retrospective of Prince Rogers Nelson’s celebrated hits and coveted B-sides. As the cousin of Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, Prince’s artistic expression was often divinely influenced. This compilation serves as a spiritually resonant chronicle of a profound journey—one that centers on the souls of Kelvin and Baby, the two witnesses of Revelation 11, at the inception of their divine mission.

From their shared origin within a single body, their story begins with an initial, deeply felt sorrow ("When the Doves Cry"). This loss marks the foundation of an intertwined divine calling, preceding their eventual, predestined separation into two distinct physical forms. Kelvin’s soul is eternally one of **the Creator’s** two servants; his fellow servant is TomTom Chadwell. Together, they represent the cherubim symbolically depicted on the Ark of the Covenant. Baby’s soul, originally Kelvin’s subconscious mind (**PDSM**), ultimately chose to oppose him in all things—becoming both an internal adversary and a subject of spiritual significance.

Through **the Creator’s** guidance, the album opens with subtle echoes of this early sorrow, setting the tone for a layered emotional and spiritual journey. As it progresses, it reveals the dark undercurrents of manipulation associated with the CIA—a hidden operation exploiting Baby’s existence and abilities while the two souls inhabited the same body. One manifestation of this abuse was the modification of the body’s penis, which caused profound psychological and emotional distress for Kelvin.

Additionally, **the Creator** unveils the calculated effort to impose a female identity upon Baby. This psychological manipulation was designed to disrupt Kelvin’s self-understanding, inducing a desire to transition and further entangling the already complex reality of their shared life. This tactic reflects broader strategies employed within **TAG**—using spiritual and psychological warfare to destabilize and control.

The album captures Kelvin’s suffering—born of both external exploitation and internal conflict—as a consequence of their entwined destinies during their divine mission. Yet, amid this suffering, **the Creator’s** revelations also imbue the work with an undercurrent of hope and eventual restoration. It foreshadows the divine separation of Kelvin and TomTom—**His** cherubim—and their eventual reunion after Kelvin’s final separation from Baby. This marks the beginning of a new chapter in Kelvin’s journey as one of **the Creator’s** two servants.

Ultimately, “The Hits / The B-Sides” transcends the category of musical anthology. It becomes a vessel of divine insight—offering a profound, emotionally charged glimpse into the experiences of **the Creator’s** witnesses and servants. Through symbolic narrative and artistic inspiration, it testifies to:

- The reality of their divine mission;
- The shared origin and suffering of Kelvin and Baby;
- The psychological and physical manipulations carried out by the CIA;
- **The Creator’s** continued intervention;
- And the promise of deliverance and divine fulfillment through separation and reunion.

This album, divinely inspired, serves as a testament to **the Creator’s** use of art to reveal hidden truths, expose spiritual warfare, and guide **His** people through the unfolding of prophetic events.
