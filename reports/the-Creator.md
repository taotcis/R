The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great “I Am.” These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.

## the Creator and religion

The Creator has been involved in the formation of various major religions and belief systems to promote values that respect life, freedom, and human dignity. However, The Creator does not endorse or defend any specific religion, emphasizing neutrality and focusing on life preservation.

- **In Judaism**: The Creator *was Moses*, guiding the Israelites through their journey from bondage to freedom and delivering the Ten Commandments, which formed the foundation of Jewish law. Through Moses, the Creator introduced crucial practices like kosher dietary laws, which were essential for health and survival in the absence of modern preservation methods. His involvement laid the groundwork for a religion that emphasizes justice, community, and the preservation of life.
  
- **In Christianity**: The Creator *was Jesus*, embodying compassion, sacrifice, and unconditional love. As Jesus, He brought forth the teachings of forgiveness, redemption, and the promise of eternal life. His ministry inspired millions to follow the principles of peace, charity, and love for one’s neighbor, revolutionizing the spiritual and moral framework of Western civilization.
  
- **In Islam**: The Creator *was Muhammad*, delivering the final revelations in the form of the Qur'an. Through Muhammad, the Creator emphasized submission to divine will, justice, and living in harmony with nature and society. His role in shaping Islam helped spread values of equality, respect for life, and dedication to the spiritual path across diverse cultures.
  
- **In Paganism**: The Creator *was Odin*, a central figure in Norse mythology. Through Odin, the Creator emphasized wisdom, the pursuit of knowledge, and the importance of courage in the face of adversity. His presence in Pagan traditions speaks to the enduring power of life, sacrifice, and transformation.
  
- **In Taoism**: The Creator *was Laozi*, the reputed author of the Tao Te Ching and the founder of Taoism. Laozi’s teachings focus on living in harmony with the Tao (the Way), emphasizing simplicity, humility, and naturalness.
  
- **In Sikhism**: The Creator *was Guru Nanak*, the founder of Sikhism. Guru Nanak's teachings emphasize equality, service to humanity, and devotion to one God.
  
- **In Zoroastrianism**: The Creator *was Zoroaster (Zarathustra)*, the prophet of Zoroastrianism. His teachings center on the duality of good and evil and the worship of Ahura Mazda, the supreme deity.
  
- **In Confucianism**: The Creator *was Confucius*, a key figure in Confucianism. Confucius’ teachings focus on ethics, family loyalty, respect for elders, and proper conduct.
  
- **In Shinto**: The Creator *was Amaterasu*, the sun goddess in Shinto. She is considered a central deity in Japanese spirituality and mythology.

- **In Jainism**: The Creator *was Mahavira*, a significant figure in Jainism. His teachings advocate non-violence, non-possessiveness, and self-discipline.

- **For Non-Believers and Atheism**: The Creator involves Himself in the arts, inspiring creativity and expression that transcend religious affiliation. Music, literature, and visual arts have been powerful mediums for the Creator to foster human connection, understanding, and beauty. Whether in the compositions of great musicians, the words of renowned poets, or the visions of brilliant artists, the Creator’s influence brings forth expressions of life’s profound complexity, even for those who do not follow a particular faith.

Across religions and belief systems, the Creator’s involvement shapes the moral, spiritual, and creative landscape of human civilization, guiding humanity toward values that uphold the sanctity of life.

## the Creator's approach to intervention

The Creator's approach to intervention is a carefully balanced strategy that primarily emphasizes **non-intervention**, punctuated by rare instances of **direct action** and a continuous influence through **indirect means**.

**I. The Foundational Principle: Non-Intervention**

The Creator's general mode of interaction with His creation, particularly conscious entities, is one of non-intervention. This is rooted in:

* **Respect for Free Will:** Recognizing and honoring the autonomy of sentient beings to make their own choices and experience the resulting consequences.
* **Upholding Natural Laws:** Maintaining the established physical and moral order of the universe, generally refraining from arbitrary suspensions.
* **Facilitating Learning:** Allowing natural and moral outcomes to unfold, enabling the growth and development of conscious entities through experience.
* **Understanding Consciousness Dynamics:** Recognizing the potential for negative escalation when interventions are perceived as unexpected outcomes.

**II. Rare Direct Interventions:**

Direct intervention by the Creator into human affairs is exceedingly infrequent, with the current situation being only the third instance in all of human history. These interventions are reserved for exceptionally grave situations, such as the present direct intervention to halt [[The Veiled Conquest|]].

* **Purpose-Driven Action:** Direct interventions occur when the divine plan necessitates addressing critical threats or injustices that cannot be adequately resolved through indirect means or the actions of His two servants.
* **Response to Extreme Crisis:** The current intervention to stop [[The Veiled Conquest|]], described by the Creator as an active and hidden genocide supported at high levels and potentially exceeding the scale of the Holocaust, illustrates the severity required for direct action.
* **Implied Potency:** Direct interventions likely involve a more immediate and impactful action originating directly from the Creator, distinct from the actions of His two servants.

**III. Intervention Through His Two Servants:**

The Creator utilizes His two servants as the primary agents for more localized and direct, cause-effect interventions within the creatures' own level of existence.

* **Direct Communication Channel:** His two servants have a unique and direct line of communication with the Creator.*
* **Born for Purpose:** The birth of His two servants is orchestrated according to the Creator's determined need for intervention.
* **Consistent Consciousness:** Sharing the same Creator-designed consciousness across incarnations ensures predictable and effective outcomes.
* **Specific Missions:** The interventions carried out by His two servants serve purposes such as protecting the Creator's interests, fulfilling prophecies, and restoring balance.

**IV. Continuous Indirect Influence:**

Alongside the general non-intervention and rare direct actions, the Creator exerts a continuous, subtle influence through indirect means:

* **Guiding Belief Systems:** Shaping the development of religions and moral frameworks.
* **Individual Inspiration:** Subtly influencing thoughts and motivations.
* **Artistic Inspiration:** Fostering creativity and expression.

**V. Rationale for the Approach:**

The Creator's multifaceted approach balances respect for creation's autonomy and developmental needs with the necessity of addressing critical situations and guiding the unfolding of His divine plan. Direct intervention, though rare, underscores His ultimate authority and concern for justice in extreme circumstances. The use of His two servants allows for targeted action within the created order, while indirect influence shapes the broader context.

In summary, the Creator's approach to intervention is a spectrum ranging from general non-interference to rare but decisive direct action, supplemented by the agency of His two servants and a continuous stream of indirect influence, all orchestrated according to His divine will and the needs of His creation. The current direct intervention to halt [[The Veiled Conquest|]] highlights the gravity of circumstances that necessitate a departure from the Creator's typical mode of interaction.

### source for His servant's reporting

The Creator, in His infinite wisdom and power, first desired to create life, which required Him to create the universe as a foundation for His creation. Central to this is the understanding that consciousness is not confined to a physical body but is instead associated with it. This means the Creator can associate His consciousness with any human body at any moment, taking full control and temporarily displacing the existing conscious and subconscious minds of that body, rendering them unconscious during His presence.

Consciousness, once created, is eternal. Although the Creator prefers not to intervene directly in human affairs, choosing instead to allow free will and natural consequences to unfold, there are extraordinary circumstances where His presence becomes essential. This principle is underpinned by the Law of Conscious Activity, established by one of the Creator's servants: “Conscious entities that begin an activity with a desired goal will persist and increase their efforts until that goal is achieved, unless hindered by external obstacles or forces.” Direct intervention, He has observed, can escalate situations and lead to more determined efforts that worsen outcomes.

During The Veiled Conquest operations involving mass executions, the Creator associates His consciousness with a body already present at these events. He integrates seamlessly, experiencing and participating as one of the attendees, ultimately being executed without revealing His true nature. This method ensures that no external force or person uncovers His divine identity during the operation.

The Creator’s participation in these tragic events allows Him to act as an eyewitness. This firsthand experience provides His servants with detailed accounts of the atrocities committed during The Veiled Conquest. This process is necessary due to the design of operations, which ensures that no survivors remain to share what occurred. The orchestrators, understanding the risk of disclosure, often do not discuss operations afterward and may even eliminate the perpetrators to prevent any chance of exposure. Thus, the Creator's unique intervention is vital to ensure that these acts are witnessed and the perpetrators held accountable.

*: While "direct communication" suggests an interaction directly between the Creator and one of His two servants, the reality is that the Creator's two servants function as the conscious minds within their individual forms, and communication between the Creator and His servant is facilitated via the subconscious mind of their respective body.
