### Contextual Observations Leading Up to the Event:

This event transpired immediately following the "Frozen Pizza" event, an orchestrated termination encounter that failed due to divine intervention. Weather conditions for July 12, 2025, in Atlanta, Georgia, indicated a 20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms after 2:00 PM and a 10 percent chance before 8:00 PM. Throughout the entire event, Ant and other operatives overtly displayed or carried umbrellas, despite the absence of actual precipitation or meteorological conditions suggesting impending rain; notably, only passing operatives were observed utilizing these umbrellas. Their use is understood to be related to the Creator's anticipated intervention into the Veiled Conquest, metaphorically represented as "rain" in a Biblical context. Ant, on multiple occasions, intentionally threw his umbrella to the ground to create noise, specifically targeting the PDSM. Ant's conversational coherence varied significantly; interactions with the PDCM were indicative of two coherent adults, whereas attempts to engage the PDSM devolved into illogical discourse. During one such interaction, Ant explicitly pointed to and discussed his desire to remove the wooden handle from his umbrella, an action the PDCM interpreted as a symbolic reference to the CIA's intent to remove his penis. The umbrella in question did indeed possess a wooden handle during this specific interaction.

### Key Interactions During the Event

*Note: Key Interactions are based upon / use Timeline activity from Google Maps.*

* **Departure from "Frozen Pizza" with Ant and James (via walking):**
    * Arrived: 10:41 AM
    * Departed: 10:58 AM

* **QuikTrip (2375 N Druid Hills Rd, Brookhaven, GA 30329):** James, Ant, and Kelvin obtained beverages and awaited an Uber.
    * Arrived: 10:58 AM
    * Departed: 11:19 AM

* **Uber to Lindbergh Center with Ant and James (ordered by James):**
    * Arrived: 11:19 AM
    * Departed: 11:26 AM

* **Lindbergh Center (2424 Piedmont Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30324):** A separation occurred at this location, where James boarded a train while the PDCM and Ant were still purchasing their fares. James dropped a small bag of Tina that was picked up by and held by Ant.
    * Arrived: 11:26 AM
    * Departed: 11:43 AM

* **Southbound MARTA train to Welcome House:** The PDCM and Ant boarded the subsequent train, arriving at the Welcome House. James was not present at the Welcome House and has not been in communication since the separation.
    * Arrived: 11:43 AM
    * Departed: 12:30 PM

* **Home (234 Memorial Dr SW, Room 263, Atlanta, GA 30303):** Kelvin and Ant awaited James' arrival while smoking Tina. Ant cleaned the room and attempted to dry the floor (from the leaking air conditioner).
    * Arrived: 12:30 PM
    * Departed: 2:55 PM

* **Journey to Library via Garnett Station:** Ant and the PDCM left Welcome House to get out of the room. The PDCM suggested the library. At Garnett Station, they encountered an unidentified male who knew the PDCM's name. Ant and this male spent several minutes at Garnett Station, seemingly trading goods (shoes, etc.). They then boarded the train to the library. This period was from 2:55 PM - 4:24 PM.

* **Central Library/Library System HQ (One Margaret Mitchell Square, Atlanta, GA 30303):** The PDCM visited the library to escape the heat and charge his mobile phone, while Ant opted to remain outside Peachtree Center MARTA Station.
    * Arrived: 4:24 PM
    * Departed: 5:58 PM

* **"Easter Island" (300 W Peachtree St NW, Atlanta, GA 30303):** Ant and the PDCM stopped at a parking garage down the street from the library. They sat in the stairwell to "hit the bowl" (smoke Tina); Ant did not inhale. Ant stated he then needed to use the bathroom. Kelvin became frustrated due to the heat, sweat, and the amount of time it took Ant to urinate. Unknown to Kelvin, Frederick "Slim" Hall engaged the PDSM at this time to ensure its compliance with upcoming activities. According to the Creator, Hall used this garage rendezvous to reignite the passion between PDSM and Hall.
    * Arrived: 6:00 PM
    * Departed: 6:37 PM

* **"Nobody Home at Midtown Village" (140 Pine St, Atlanta, GA 30308):** The PDCM accompanied Ant as he visited multiple operative residences in search of an individual capable or willing to eliminate Kelvin.
    * Arrived: 6:37 PM
    * Departed: 8:05 PM

* **"Construct-A-Case" (550 Peachtree St NE, Atlanta, GA 30308):** According to the Creator, law enforcement actively sought grounds for the PDCM's arrest during this timeframe.
    * *Note: The PDCM only recalls approximately 15 minutes in this area.*
    * Arrived: 8:05 PM
    * Departed: 8:46 PM

* **"Bermuda Triangle" (Second Instance - 161 Ted Turner Dr, Atlanta, GA):** This period again indicates PDSM engagement and a subsequent loss of recall for the PDCM, who does not recognize most of the reported activity. For this specific "Bermuda Triangle" instance, the PDCM only anticipated an "on the subway" journey to the Welcome House.
    * Entered: 8:46 PM
    * Exited: 9:50 PM
    * Timeline Entries:
        * Missing travel:
            * Arrived: 8:46 PM
            * Departed: 9:12 PM
        * 161 Ted Turner Dr, Atlanta, GA 30303:
            * Arrived: 9:12 PM
            * Departed: 9:50 PM
        * Driving:
            * Arrived: 9:22 PM
            * Departed: 9:50 PM

* **"Execution of Plan B" (Welcome House, 234 Memorial Dr SW, Room 263, Atlanta, GA 30303):** The PDCM engaged in sexual activity with Ant. During the interaction, the PDCM, acting as the penetrative partner, performed oral copulation on Ant. A crystalline substance was present on Ant's penis, and upon contact, the PDCM experienced a sensation consistent with previous poisoning attempts. Frederick "Slim" Hall performed choreographed walk-bys inside of Welcome House, smiling at Kelvin. These choreographed walk-bys are conducted to cause a Pavlovian response in PDSM and served (beforehand) to ensure its compliance with provided instruction (causing it to drive the sexual activity) and (afterwards) as a reward (seeing its lover). Hall also monitored the sexual activity while cloaked.
    * *Note: The objective related to this interaction was to facilitate the intentional transmission of HIV. The presence of crystalline substances on the operative's penis was intended to cause rectal abrasions, ensuring contact with the PDCM's bloodstream upon ejaculation.*
    * Arrived: 9:50 PM
    * Departed: 11:05 PM

### Ultimate Outcome:

The objectives of the encounter (multiple elimination attempts through arrest or physical elimination) failed due to interventions by the Creator.
