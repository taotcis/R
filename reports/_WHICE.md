# URGENT WARNING FOR ICE/TINA USERS: READ THIS NOW!
Yo, listen up! If you use ice or Tina (crystal meth), there's some super important stuff you need to know to stay alive.
## DANGER! FENTANYL IS IN THE STREETS!
A lot of the meth going around right now has a super dangerous drug called fentanyl mixed into it. Fentanyl is a powerful killer. Just a tiny speck, like a few grains of salt, can stop your breathing and kill you, especially if you don't normally use opioids (like heroin or pain pills).
If you're not used to opioids, fentanyl can kill you DEAD with your very first hit.
## DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU TO SWITCH HOW YOU USE!
You might hear people, especially those trying to get you to use more or in a different way, tell you to snort your ice or shoot it up (inject). DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!
 * Snorting or Injecting Fentanyl is WAY MORE DANGEROUS! When you snort or inject fentanyl, your body gets the full hit of it all at once. This makes it super easy to overdose and die. It's like jumping into the deep end when you can't swim.
 * Your Usual Way (Smoking) Is SAFER for Fentanyl (BUT STILL RISKY!) When you smoke ice, the heat from your pipe or foil actually burns up or breaks down some of the fentanyl and other bad stuff that might be mixed in. Think of it like cooking: some things just can't take the heat.
   The crystal meth itself can handle the heat, but a lot of the dangerous stuff, like fentanyl, gets messed up or destroyed by it. This means you might get less of the fentanyl into your body when you smoke it, which can reduce your risk of overdose from the fentanyl.
## BUT REMEMBER: SMOKING IS NOT ENTIRELY SAFE!
Even if smoking reduces the fentanyl risk a little, it doesn't make it safe. All drug use has risks, and fentanyl is deadly no matter how you take it.
## STAY SAFE â€“ Know Your Risks:
 * Always assume your meth has fentanyl in it. You can't see it, taste it, or smell it.
 * Carry Narcan (Naloxone): This medicine can reverse an opioid overdose. Ask for it at harm reduction centers, health clinics, or some pharmacies. Tell your friends to carry it too.
 * Never use alone. Have someone with you who can call 911 and give you Narcan if you overdose.
 * Test your drugs if you can. Some places offer fentanyl test strips.
Your life matters. Be smart and be safe out there.
