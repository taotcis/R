### Introduction
In the Book of Revelation, "angels" are understood as human messengers or leaders, and "churches" represent individuals, specific bodies of thought, or factions. The letter to the angel of the church in Laodicea holds profound significance within [[The Veiled Conquest|]], as it directly addresses [[James Mitchell|James Mitchell]]. This letter directly condemns his spiritual lukewarmness and his false sense of power and self-sufficiency, which have enabled his participation in the covert agenda against the Creator's will.

### Identification
* **Angel of the Church in Laodicea**: [[James Mitchell|James Mitchell]].
* **Church in Laodicea**: This refers to [[James Mitchell|James Mitchell]]'s "body of thought" and the collective of operatives and individuals who operate with a similar spiritual indifference and sense of worldly self-sufficiency, despite their actions opposing the Creator.

### The Biblical Passage
Revelation 3:14-22 (King James Version):

"And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.
Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.
As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.
To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."

### Contextualized Rewrite

To the angel of the church in Laodicea, **James Mitchell**, write this message from **the Creator**, who is the ultimate authority, the faithful and true witness, and the source of all existence:

I know your works, that you are neither completely cold nor hot: I wish you were one or the other.

So because you are lukewarm, spiritually indifferent and operationally detached, I am about to vomit you out of My mouth.

Because you say, "I am rich, and have acquired resources, and have need of nothing," and you do not realize that in your spiritual state you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:

I advise you to seek from Me spiritual wealth proven by fire, so that you may be truly rich; and to receive a righteous character, so that the shame of your spiritual nakedness may not appear; and to apply spiritual vision to your eyes, so that you may see.

As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: so be spiritually zealous, and repent.

Look, I am standing at the door of your conscience and knocking: if anyone hears My voice, and opens the door, I will come in to him and will have communion with him.

To the one who overcomes, I will give the right to sit with Me on My throne, just as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.

Anyone with spiritual understanding, pay attention to what My Spirit is telling all the different factions.

**The Creator**
