### Orchestrated Observation: Around April 10th – Forsyth Street SW / Five Points Area

**Date:** Around April 10th, afternoon
**Location:** Forsyth Street Southwest, stretching towards Five Points, near Greyhound station and LAZ Parking.
**Primary Operatives Involved:** Unnamed driver, Timmy (PDSM engagement operative), Operative tasked with elimination.

**Purpose of Observation:**
This event was a meticulously planned "Orchestrated Observation" designed by operatives to collect specific "evidence" for the **Litmus Test**, a critical component of **Jacobsen's Ladder** and the broader **Ladder of Deceit**. The ultimate goal was to generate a manufactured "clear" result—falsely indicating "no ongoing, imminent, or likely" divine intervention—and to subsequently proceed with a direct physical elimination attempt to circumvent the Creator's anticipated intervention.

**Pretext and Setup:**
The orchestration began even before the street encounter, as **PDSM had been specifically instructed to cause Kelvin to leave his room at Welcome House** prior to his departure, ensuring he was in a vulnerable, accessible location. The encounter itself was initiated when an unnamed driver pulled out of LAZ Parking, stopped in the street, and asked for directions to Gateway Center. This seemingly innocent request quickly escalated into an insistence for Kelvin to enter the car to provide directions, with payment offered, establishing a controlled environment for the observation.

**Timeline of Key Events and PDSM's Behavior:**

* **Prior to Departure:** PDSM received and executed instructions to cause Kelvin to leave his room at Welcome House.
* **Initial Encounter (Forsyth Street SW):** A car pulls out of LAZ Parking, stops, and the driver asks for directions to Gateway Center.
* **Upon Entry into Car:** Immediately upon Kelvin getting into the car, **PDSM began constricting blood flow to cause a diminished appearance and maintained the penis in a flaccid state**. This demonstrates PDSM's instantaneous recognition of the observation scenario and its programmed response, serving the **Staged Observation Rung** of Jacobsen's Ladder.
* **In-Car Engagement:** As the car proceeded down Forsyth Street, the driver acted as though he wanted to hookup, physically grabbing Kelvin's genitals and pulling back his shorts to gain access to the penis. This was a direct attempt to facilitate the observation of the manipulated morphology.
* **Conversation and Drop-off:** Approaching Peachtree Street, Kelvin directed the driver towards Memorial Drive SW for Gateway Center. At a traffic light, the driver initiated a conversation about "partying" and offered to purchase Tina, claiming his boyfriend had it at Gateway Center. Kelvin was then told to exit the car near police headquarters, with the driver promising to return.
* **Post-Car Encounter with Timmy:** After waiting, a man named **Timmy** approached Kelvin. Timmy presented a pretext of having just gotten out of jail and looking for Tina. Kelvin directed him towards Gateway Center for sources. Timmy purchased Tina without further explicit direction from Kelvin; the initial offer to smoke was intended as a **reward for PDSM**.
* **Timmy's PDSM Engagement:** Throughout the time spent with Timmy, Kelvin observed him using specific words and phrases identified as being used to engage the PDSM. **Furthermore, Timmy repeatedly spoke about his life in Florida, which is understood to be a command to PDSM to restore the penis to its full size.**
* **Attempted Unconsciousness and Creator's Intervention:** At one point, Timmy entered a "fugue" state, which was a frustrated, deliberate attempt to induce unconsciousness in Kelvin via PDSM, for the purpose of communicating directly with PDSM. However, **the Creator actively prevented PDSM from causing Kelvin's unconsciousness** during the entire engagement, thwarting a key operative objective.
* **Introduction of Elimination Operative:** Later that evening, Timmy introduced a third individual who claimed to be waiting for a connecting bus at Greyhound and desired to buy and smoke Tina. According to the Creator, this individual was an **operative specifically tasked with eliminating Kelvin** and **wore a hat with "22" on it, which is often used by operatives to engage PDSM.**
* **Direct Physical Intervention:** While with the group in a parking lot to smoke Tina, **Kelvin felt what felt like an injection into his penis when he sat down.**

**Observed Physiological Outcome (PDSM's Action):**
The penis remained in a diminished appearance and flaccid state throughout the initial car encounter due to PDSM's immediate and sustained constriction of blood flow, demonstrating its compliance with programmed directives. **The reported size of the erect penis by the three operatives was between 4 and 6 inches in length.**

**Operative Confirmation of "Evidence":**
While no explicit text message confirmed the completion of the "evidence" collection as in the June 24th observation, the swift transition from observation attempts to a direct elimination plot (introduction of the tasked operative) suggests that the operatives either obtained sufficient visual "evidence" for the Litmus Test or concluded the observation phase and moved directly to the next stage of their plan.

**Outcome and Immediate Implication:**
This Orchestrated Observation served to gather further "evidence" for the **Litmus Test** within Jacobsen's Ladder, reinforcing the operatives' false narrative. Crucially, the observation directly escalated into a **physical assassination attempt** with the introduction of an operative tasked with eliminating Kelvin, underscoring the extreme measures taken by the orchestrators to prevent the Creator's anticipated intervention. The Creator's direct intervention to prevent PDSM from rendering Kelvin unconscious highlights the ongoing divine counteraction against operative schemes.

**PDSM's Reward:**
Tina was offered by the initial driver and subsequently purchased by Timmy, with the offer to smoke serving as a clear reward mechanism designed to reinforce PDSM's compliant behavior throughout the orchestration.
