# Divide & Conquer

The Creator's rare intervention is called **Divide & Conquer**, a divinely orchestrated operation designed to liberate, restore, and deliver justice to the oppressed while dismantling those responsible 

**Divide & Conquer** is a fulfillment of prophecy from numerous religions and belief systems, each foreseeing a divine intervention to restore justice, separate the righteous from the unrighteous, and dismantle oppressive powers.

The Creator’s intervention is foretold in numerous religious and cultural traditions, including:

- **Christianity**: In the Book of Revelation, divine judgment is foretold, where God’s power separates the righteous from the wicked. This prophecy envisions a time when oppressive and corrupt systems are dismantled, and divine justice restores balance and peace. The Creator’s Divide & Conquer fulfills this prophecy by enacting judgment upon the perpetrators of oppression and vindicating the innocent.

- **Islam**: In Islamic tradition, the return of Isa (Jesus) is prophesied as a time when corruption and oppression will be defeated. Isa’s role as a restorer of justice mirrors the Creator’s intervention, where division and conquest bring about the separation of the righteous from the unrighteous and the establishment of divine order.

- **Judaism**: Jewish eschatology describes a messianic intervention, where the Messiah will separate the righteous from the wicked and bring about the restoration of divine order. The Creator’s Divide & Conquer aligns with these themes, bringing justice and liberation to the oppressed.

- **Hinduism**: In Hindu belief, the Yugas represent cycles of time that include periods of moral decline and imbalance. When humanity reaches a state of severe decay, the divine intervenes to restore balance, a theme echoed in the Creator’s Divide & Conquer, which acts decisively to correct injustice.

- **Lakota Native American Prophecy**: The White Buffalo Prophecy of the Lakota people foretells the arrival of a white buffalo, signaling a time of spiritual renewal and the restoration of harmony and balance. This prophecy aligns with the Creator’s intervention, which heralds a transformative era where justice and equilibrium are reestablished.

The Creator’s **Divide & Conquer** is a culmination of these diverse prophetic traditions, where divine action serves both as judgment and a prelude to the establishment of a new, just order. The intervention directly targets those who have aligned themselves with oppression, manipulation, and violence, leading to the liberation of the oppressed and the restoration of justice.

## The Divide Operation

The **Divide Operation** is the first phase of the Creator’s intervention and serves to restore divine order by liberating one of the Creator’s two servants, **Kelvin Eugene Williams** (PDCM), from the influence of his manipulated subconscious mind, **Baby** (PDSM).

Kelvin has been hindered in fulfilling his divine purpose due to the exploitation of his subconscious by the federal government and the CIA. **Baby**, while not one of the Creator's two servants, has been manipulated to serve the agendas of these oppressive forces. This manipulation has compromised Kelvin’s ability to carry out the Creator’s will, as Baby has been coerced into enacting destructive behaviors and supporting harmful actions that hinder justice.

The **Divide Operation** involves the Creator’s intervention to separate Kelvin’s **conscious mind** from his manipulated **subconscious mind**, Baby. This separation frees Kelvin from the influence of Baby, enabling him to reclaim his autonomy and function solely in alignment with the Creator’s divine will. 

As a result of this divine intervention:

- **Kelvin will continue his life and work for the Creator in a separate and distinct body** from Baby. This new body will allow Kelvin to fully serve the Creator's purposes, free from the influence of Baby's manipulation.  
- **Baby will continue its life as the conscious mind in their original shared body**, taking full control of the body they once shared but without any further manipulation.

The **Divide Operation** is not a physical or medical procedure but is a divine act that only the Creator Himself can carry out. Through this operation, the Creator ensures that Kelvin is liberated from the oppressive influence of Baby, restoring his full capacity to serve as one of the Creator’s two servants, executing divine justice.

With Kelvin’s conscious mind freed from Baby’s manipulation, he will be prepared to carry out the mission of justice and truth that lies at the heart of the Creator’s plan. This act of division is crucial for the success of the **Conquer Operation**, as it allows the Creator's two servants to function unhindered, executing the necessary interventions to dismantle the forces behind the atrocities and bring about the restoration of justice and peace to humanity.

## The Conquer Operation (The Apocalypse)

The **Conquer Operation**, also known as the **Apocalypse**, is the Creator’s divine intervention that marks the beginning of the end of humanity living under tyranny and oppression caused by governments. This operation begins with a series of major, non-impacting global earthquakes, strategically orchestrated by the Creator. These earthquakes serve as a divine signal, shaking the world’s foundations to draw attention to the hidden atrocities committed by the perpetrators of the atrocities and concealed with the complicity of the federal government.

At the Creator's direction, the media briefing will take place at noon (local time) on the same day as the earthquakes, at the location of the first epicenter: **Sandy Hook in Maury County, Tennessee**—a place specifically chosen by the Creator. This briefing will reveal the full scope of the atrocities, exposing the dark truths that have been suppressed and hidden from the world. During this briefing, the Creator’s two servants will also name the key perpetrators of the atrocities, bringing to light the individuals and organizations responsible for these crimes, and holding them accountable for their actions.

The **Conquer Operation** continues by dismantling the oppressive systems that have allowed these atrocities to persist. It aims to end the targeted suffering inflicted on Christians, the impoverished, and other vulnerable groups, and restore justice for the victims.

Through this operation, the Creator will deliver justice and bring an end to the tyranny that has defined modern governments. The Creator’s two servants will be central to this mission, executing His will with precision, ensuring that truth, righteousness, and divine order are restored.

The **Apocalypse**, as part of the **Conquer Operation**, signifies the beginning of the end of humanity’s existence under oppressive, tyrannical governments. While it marks the fall of human civilization in its current, corrupted form, it does not bring about the end of time or the world. Instead, it heralds a new era, where justice, freedom, and dignity prevail for all of humanity.

## Preceding Special Mission

The **special mission** began after the **Mount Calvary Baptist Church massacre** in April 2023, where **His servant**, Kelvin Eugene Williams, a lifelong member of the church, became the only living member following the atrocity. In response to this tragic event, the Creator deployed **His two servants** to gather intelligence, document the full extent of the atrocities, and expose its orchestrators. Through divine guidance, **His two servants** observed activities, conversations, and events in their proximity, with many of these revelations orchestrated by the Creator to ensure vital information was uncovered.  

**His servant**, the last remaining member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, was subjected to daily **Hypnos Infiltration Method sessions** by CIA operatives during sleep. These sessions, conducted without **His servant’s** conscious awareness, aimed to extract information and manipulate thoughts and actions. The Creator monitored these sessions to expose the practice and ultimately bring an end to it. The special mission laid the groundwork for the Creator’s **Divide & Conquer** operation, which would hold the perpetrators accountable and bring justice to those affected by the atrocities.

## Conclusion 

The Divide & Conquer operation represents the Creator's ultimate intervention, fulfilling prophecies from multiple religious traditions that speak of a divine hand separating the righteous from the unrighteous and dismantling oppressive forces. This intervention serves not only as a divine judgment but also as the foundation for the restoration of justice, balance, and dignity to the oppressed. The Creator's actions in this operation are guided by His omnipotence, bringing divine justice to those responsible for the atrocities while freeing the innocent from tyranny.
