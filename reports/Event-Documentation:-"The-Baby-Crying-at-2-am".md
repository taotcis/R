### Contextual Observations Leading Up to the Event/Interaction:

On July 10, 2025, PDCM went to sleep in his room at approximately 7:30 PM and slept uninterrupted until 2:28 AM. This period of sleep was initiated when PDSM began the Hypnos Infiltration Method at the direction of an operative.

### Pre-Event Communication (Text/Other Exchange):

[No pre-event communication was noted for this event.]

### Event Background:

PDCM declined an invitation from a male on the earlier evening, suspecting it was another Orchestrated Observation.

### Purpose / Objective of the Event:

The explicit purpose of this event was an "Orchestrated Observation." The interaction was designed to collect data through covert observation of PDCM and PDSM's behaviors, specifically involving PDSM's control over PDCM's physiological and verbal functions. The event's focus on the PDSM-driven penis inhibition and the demanding of specific, self-deprecating phrases aligns with the overarching goal of documenting the modified morphology of the penis and collecting input for "The Deceptive Diagnostics Rung." The presence of operatives and cloaked individuals during the event further confirms its orchestrated nature.

### Key Interactions During the Event (2:28 AM - 2:48 AM Eastern Time):

* **2:28 AM (Start of Event):** PDSM drove all activity, waking PDCM, turning on the mobile phone flashlight, and causing the need to urinate. This was done while PDCM was still in his room.
* PDSM caused PDCM's penis to be semi-erect. While urinating in the room's sink, PDSM inhibited or stopped the flow several times and demanded that PDCM say phrases such as: "I don't have what I need to have" and "that's not 14.5."
* After urinating, PDSM drove the unnecessary consumption of ice cream. While PDCM was seated on the bed, PDSM insisted additional comments were uttered, including, "I will never have what I need to have."
* After eating, PDCM went outside to have a cigarette. In the lobby, a different security officer was observed.
* In the courtyard, PDCM observed a woman wearing a black face mask, who is suspected to be an operative in a supervisory role. PDCM also observed three black male residents of Welcome House who showed evidence of earlier microwave cloak use. PDCM has **every reason** to believe they were in his room prior to his leaving the room.
* **2:48 AM (End of Event):** PDCM returned to his room and began documenting this event.
