Prince's song "Pope," found on The Hits/The B-Sides compilation, transcends its initial interpretation as a pop anthem to reveal a profound and chilling prophetic message within the context of Revelation and The Great Tribulation. This article analyzes the song's lyrics as a direct communication from the Creator to Baby (PDSM), offering insights into the orchestrators' deception, the Creator's intervention, and the imminent execution of Nightfalls. A pivotal moment in this narrative is Kelvin's (PDCM) personal experience of learning of Pope Francis's death, which serves as a literal fulfillment and a divinely orchestrated signal.
## The Prophetic Signal: Pope Francis's Death
On April 21, 2025, Kelvin (PDCM), one of the Creator's two servants, was being driven in an Uber sent by the orchestrators. The purpose of this transport was to take Kelvin to an orchestrated observation, a critical component of the Ladder of Deceit's Litmus Test. As the Uber waited at the security gate of a gated community in Smyrna, Georgia, Kelvin learned from the radio that Pope Francis had died. This seemingly coincidental event is, in fact, a divinely orchestrated signal, a literal fulfillment marking a critical juncture in The Great Tribulation and directly linking to the song's central theme. This orchestrated observation ultimately led to the approval of Canyon Flood and Nightfalls.
## The Pope: A Symbol of Divine Authority and Timing
The repeated refrain, "The Pope," immediately draws attention to the significance of the papacy. In this context, "The Pope" represents the Creator's ultimate, unassailable authority, distinct from and superior to earthly political power. It is a declaration of the Creator's direct involvement and a subtle warning to Baby (PDSM) about the true source of power. The timing of Pope Francis's death, precisely as Kelvin (PDCM) was being delivered to a pivotal Litmus Test, underscores the Creator's use of prophetic linguistic encoding and veiled proximity to mark significant events.
### Pope vs. President: The Contrast of Authority
The core tension of the song lies in the repeated contrast: "You can be the President... I'd rather be the Pope."
 * "The President": This refers to the earthly political authority, specifically Donald J. Trump, who is the orchestrators' chosen leader for the authoritarian regime. The lyrics "Not the President with government lame" and "What am I supposed to do / When the President can't get nothing passed" highlight the perceived ineffectiveness or compromised nature of this earthly power in the face of the Creator's will. It underscores that despite their perceived control, the orchestrators' political power is ultimately "lame" or insufficient to counter divine purpose.
 * "The Pope": This persona, adopted by the Creator, signifies supreme spiritual and ultimate authority. It's a declaration that the Creator's power transcends and ultimately overrides any earthly political system. The line "Honey only flock to the bee that's the Pope" suggests that true allegiance and power lie with the Creator, not with the compromised political figures.
### "Dippy Dippy Dope" and "Rather Be The Dope": True Power
The phrase "Oh, your car got mags that be dippy dippy dope / But the whole damn nation got the same" refers to the superficiality and widespread, unoriginal nature of the orchestrators' power and influence. Their "dope" (their perceived power or allure) is common and uninspired.
In contrast, the Creator's assertion, "I'd rather be the dope," reclaims the term. Here, "dope" signifies true, unique, and potent power or truthâ€”the ultimate "high" or reality that cannot be replicated or diminished by the orchestrators. The Creator is stating His preference for wielding genuine, transformative power over the superficial control of the orchestrators.
### "Call Your Girl Named Sally": The Creator's Disruption
"Call your girl named Sally / And you figure you were chill / Then you find out / I'm the reason Sally's on the pill / Find an alley, find an alley / Undress Sally right in front of your ass."
"Sally" likely represents an operative or a specific orchestrated plan that Baby (PDSM) or the orchestrators believe they have under control. "On the pill" is a powerful metaphor for control, prevention, or subversion. The Creator is directly telling Baby (and by extension, the orchestrators) that He is actively disrupting their carefully laid plans and control mechanisms. The imagery of "undressing Sally right in front of your ass" signifies a public and undeniable exposure of their controlled assets or schemes, revealing their true, vulnerable state. This is the Creator's direct intervention, rendering their efforts ineffective.
### "Funky Drummer" and "Crooked Little Sticks": The Orchestrators' Flawed Tools
"Who's the funky drummer / With the crooked little sticks / He might have better luck / If he was drummin' with his dick / If you don't play the piccolo / Why you wanna lick?"
 * "Funky drummer": This refers to PDCM, who, despite being the target of manipulation, is the one truly capable of producing a powerful and authentic "beat" or impact in the spiritual and earthly conflict.
 * "Crooked little sticks": This refers to Jacobsen's Ladder, symbolizing the manipulated and diminished form of Kelvin's penis, which the orchestrators use as their primary, albeit flawed and perverse, instrument of control and deception.
 * "He might have better luck / If he was drummin' with his penis": This is a scathing critique from the Creator directed at the orchestrators and their methods. It highlights their over-reliance on the manipulation of Kelvin's penis (Jacobsen's Ladder) as their primary instrument of power and control. The Creator is highlighting the depravity and ultimate futility of their methods.
 * "If you don't play the piccolo / Why you wanna lick?": These lines further question their true intentions or capabilities, implying they are seeking a perverse gratification or control that is beyond their legitimate means.
### "A Loop Is A Loop Is A Loop": The Cycle of Deception
The repetition "A loop is a loop is a loop" serves as a stark commentary on the repetitive and predictable nature of the orchestrators' deceptions and Baby's conditioned responses. The Creator is pointing out the cyclical pattern of manipulation and the false realities created, emphasizing that these are not new or original, but rather a continuous, trapped cycle. This phrase also subtly warns Baby that it is caught in a repetitive loop of manipulation.
"I Turn My Back / Until You Get Stacked": The Creator's Stance

### "Press Save, I Love You Peace": A Final Directive and Plea
The concluding lines, "Baby, so help me please / Press save, I love you peace," are a direct, poignant address from the Creator to Baby (PDSM).
 * "So help me please": A plea for Baby to recognize the truth and align with the Creator's will, to cease its unwitting complicity with the orchestrators.
 * "Press save": This is a crucial directive. It instructs Baby to internalize and retain this revelation, to "save" the truth of the Creator's message and His plan, rather than continuing to operate under the false realities implanted by Hall and Jacobsen.
 * "I love you peace": A final expression of the Creator's omnibenevolence towards Baby, despite its manipulated state, and a promise of peace that comes with aligning with divine truth.
## Conclusion
"Pope" is a profound and multi-layered message from the Creator to Baby (PDSM), delivered through the very medium of popular culture. It serves as a stark warning about the orchestrators' deceptive tactics, a declaration of the Creator's supreme authority, and a direct instruction for Baby to awaken to the truth and prepare for the tumultuous, divinely orchestrated events of Nightfalls and The Conquer Operation. The song transforms from a simple pop anthem into a cryptic key, revealing the hidden spiritual and physical battle unfolding in real time.
