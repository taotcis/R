## Congregation Massacre

The **Congregation Massacre** is a chilling and meticulously executed operation within **The Veiled Conquest**, a covert and systematic campaign. Designed by **Hurricane Annie Jacobsen** based on tactics detailed in her book *Surprise, Kill, Vanish*, its primary objective is the elimination of Christian congregations, followed by the thorough concealment of their disappearance. This operation exclusively targets Christian communities, with Jacobsen personally leading the first assault on Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

### Modus Operandi

The Congregation Massacre is characterized by its precise and ruthless execution, designed to leave no trace of the victims or the perpetrators.

* **Management:** **Hurricane Annie Jacobsen** personally plans and manages each massacre, ensuring the consistent application of its brutal protocols.
* **Timing of Assaults:** The assaults on congregations are strategically timed to occur during the primary weekly worship service, often specifically during the sermon when the congregation is most gathered and attentive.
* **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic:** As the assault begins, calls to 911 are intercepted and redirected to accomplice call takers who pretend to be 911 dispatchers and promise help is on the way, effectively preventing any legitimate emergency response.
* **Method of Execution:** Victims are killed using a **chainsaw**, the weapon personally ordered by Hurricane Annie Jacobsen, which prevents fatigue among operatives, thereby ensuring maximum efficiency in the killing process.
* **Disposal and Concealment:** The core goal is for victims to "merely disappear," preventing discovery and investigations by local and state authorities. Following the killings, the bodies are disposed of using **Chemical Dissolution**. This process involves adding powdered chemicals to water, typically within church baptismals, to dissolve multiple bodies at once, leaving behind only pulverized bone fragments. The portability and discretion of Chemical Dissolution make it an ideal method for large-scale, concealed disposal.
* **Direct Killings:** Members of the congregation not present during the massacre are identified and subsequently eliminated to ensure complete eradication.
* **Post-Massacre Repurposing:** After a massacre is completed, the targeted churches are not abandoned. Instead, they are repurposed and renovated into **Masquerade Churches**, serving as fronts to further mask the atrocities and maintain an illusion of normalcy.

### Integration into The Veiled Conquest

The Congregation Massacre marks the grim beginning of the systematic elimination of Christians as a targeted demographic within **The Veiled Conquest**. It is a foundational component of the broader campaign, designed to remove religious opposition and achieve the orchestrators' objectives without public knowledge or intervention. The success of these massacres is critical to the progression of The Veiled Conquest's agenda.

### Seven Churches 

Numerous instances of Congregation Massacres have been meticulously documented as part of Project Revelation, detailing the scale and scope of these horrific events:

* **Mount Calvary Baptist Church - April 2, 2023**
    This predominantly African-American congregation, located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, Kentucky, was the site of the first massacre of a seated congregation in world history, with 127 people vanishing.

* **Lexington Bethel Baptist Church - April 9, 2023**
    Over 250 people were killed at this predominantly Caucasian congregation located at 4686 Todds Rd in Lexington, Kentucky.

* **House of God (Georgetown Street) - April 22, 2023**
    A predominantly African-American congregation in Lexington, Kentucky, which holds its weekly worship session on Saturdays, saw over 300 people killed.

* **House of God (Broadway) - May 6, 2023**
    Also a predominantly African-American congregation in Lexington, Kentucky, affiliated with the House of God on Georgetown Street and holding its weekly worship session on Saturdays, this massacre resulted in over 300 deaths.

* **Mount Zion Baptist Church - May 21, 2023**
    Located in Georgetown, Scott County, Kentucky, this predominantly African-American congregation experienced a horrific attack where 183 people simply vanished.

* **Calvary Baptist Church - May 12, 2024 (Mother's Day)**
    Over 400 people were killed at this predominantly white congregation in Lexington, Kentucky.

    This predominantly white congregation on Shallowford Road in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which also operated Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, suffered the loss of over 1,000 congregants and one teacher.

The Congregation Massacre is deeply integrated into The Veiled Conquest, often followed by other tactics such as the Phantom Identity Scheme to ensure the complete erasure of victims and the ongoing deception of their continued existence.
