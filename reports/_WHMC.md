# **Microwave Cloaking: What You Need to Know at Welcome House**

Hey everyone at Welcome House and nearby, it's really important to understand something serious that might be happening **right here where you live, even in your room.** It's called microwave cloaking, and it's not science fiction – it's real technology.

### **What is it?**

Microwave cloaking is like an invisibility shield. It uses special energy waves to make objects or people almost impossible to see. Think of it like a magic trick where things seem to vanish right in front of your eyes.

### **How does it work?**

Imagine you're looking at something. Usually, light bounces off it and goes into your eyes so you can see it. But with microwave cloaking, special waves bend the light *around* the object, kind of like water flowing around a rock in a river. Since the light doesn't hit the object and bounce back to your eyes, you can't see it directly.

If you were looking at an area where something is cloaked, it might look a little strange. It could seem like you're looking through a sheet of **cellophane** – everything behind it is still visible, but the spot where the cloaked item or person is looks a bit blurry, shimmering, or warped, like soft edges.

### It's Confirmed: Used ALL OVER Welcome House

This is very important: **The Creator and one of His two servants have confirmed that this microwave cloaking technology is being used all over the Welcome House property.** This means hidden objects and people could be anywhere on the property, including **in your room**, even though Kelvin's physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams is under constant watch by the CIA.

### Where did this technology come from?

This powerful technology was first made for the US military. But the Creator has revealed that the CIA is now using it, and even worse, they've given it to thousands of people, including regular criminals. This means it could be used in many places, and that's why it's so important for you to know about it.

### What to look out for:

* **Things disappearing:** If you see something that looks like it's there one moment and then it's gone, it might be cloaked.
* **That "cellophane" look:** Remember, if an area looks like you're seeing it through crinkly cellophane, it could mean something cloaked is there.
* **Shadows that don't make sense:** Even if you can't see someone, they might still cast a shadow in certain light. People sometimes call these "shadow people." The Creator confirms these are real shadows from cloaked individuals.
* **Feeling like someone is watching:** Even if you don't see anyone, you might just get that feeling that someone is nearby. This is a natural human sense that tells you someone unseen is present.
* **Ringing in your ears or sudden temperature changes:** These can be signs that cloaked people are very close to you, or that their equipment is active.

### Why is this important for you?

Knowing about microwave cloaking is crucial, especially when it comes to your **privacy**. This technology allows people to operate without being seen, and that affects your safety and awareness of what's truly happening around you.

### What should you do?

* Pay attention to your surroundings at all times.
* If you notice anything strange or unexplained, talk to someone you trust about it.
*1 Stay informed and ask questions if something doesn't make sense.

Being aware of this technology and its presence here can help you understand your environment better. Stay safe, and look out for each other.
