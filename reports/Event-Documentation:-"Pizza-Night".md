## Contextual Observations Leading Up to the Event:

Jacobsen had provided to PDSM a description of McCune's profile on NKP and directed it to drive PDCM to initiate contact if McCune hadn't already.

PDCM did contact McCune on Friday afternoon after noticing his profile within 1,000 feet of his current location at the library. McCune called back immediately and stated that he was getting a hotel room and would be in contact.

Later in the evening, PDCM contacted McCune again (PDSM-driven) and PDCM was invited to come hangout at the hotel and the two agreed to engage in recreational drug use; neither mentioned sexual activity.

## Pre-Event Communication:

No transcript provided; communication was mostly voice calls.

## Event Background:

McCune told PDCM that he needed a little time to get ready and to delay arriving for about thirty minutes. PDCM agreed to delay then started walking in the direction of the hotel after about 15 minutes. PDCM contacted McCune as he approached the hotel and was told he needed a little more time, so PDCM walked around in the city for a little longer. McCune then advised PDCM to come to the hotel.

In the lobby, PDCM asked where a water fountain was and stated that he was thirsty. McCune told PDCM to get a water from the hotel's store, to which PDCM replied he didn't mind tap water. McCune then made a comment that made PDCM think he might be committing some type of credit card fraud, and PDCM told him he didn't hear anything and didn't want to know anything about it. McCune then started a conversation with the hotel's front desk staff about his room's charges and checkout. Afterward, McCune went to the store in the lobby, PDCM followed, and McCune asked him to get two bottles of water.

## Key Interactions During the Event:

1.  After sitting in the room, PDCM immediately recognized the situation as a Termination Encounter when McCune wondered out loud if he could get the credit card number used by the "agency" that paid for his room to "order a pizza" (pizza being lingo used by operatives that refers to a head/face shot) and uttered something to someone else unseen by PDCM.
2.  After sitting in the room, PDCM noticed that McCune hadn't showered as he had implied.
3.  PDCM and McCune began smoking a bowl of crystal methamphetamine. After a couple turns, PDCM passed the bowl to McCune with an ample amount of crystal methamphetamine in it. When he passed it back to PDCM, the taste was completely different and the substance was brown.
4.  PDCM smoked the obvious poison. Realizing that PDSM had caused PDCM to look away when McCune had the bowl the last time, PDCM watched the bowl intently to catch the unseen party swapping the bowls. McCune laid the bowl down on the bed instead of using it. After a while, he picked it up and smoked it.
5.  The conversation was difficult to follow and had a recurring theme of "Chicago," which PDCM recognized as repeated use of geography for instructions to PDSM regarding the sizing of his penis.
6.  After an hour or so, PDCM and McCune went outside for a cigarette. In the courtyard, PDCM noticed a practically empty hotel, evidence of cloaked operatives, and one male individual entered the courtyard just after they sat down, at which point PDCM felt the impact of a projectile.
7.  They returned to the room and had an insignificant conversation that was mostly interlaced with "Chicago" and other operative lingo used when trying to get PDSM to render PDCM unconscious.
8.  After another hour or so, PDCM returned outside alone for another cigarette. McCune came outside shortly afterwards and told PDCM he needed to get some sleep.

## Ultimate Outcome:

This was a Termination Encounter that failed due to the Creator's ongoing intervention. PDCM left the hotel and walked home, enduring several additional elimination attempts and having the feeling somebody or multiple people were following him.
