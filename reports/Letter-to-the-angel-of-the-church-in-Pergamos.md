### The Biblical Passage
Revelation 2:12-17 (King James Version):

"And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;
I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.
Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it."

### Contextualized Rewrite

**To the angel of the church in Pergamos, [[Danny Taylor|]], write this message from [[the Creator|]], who wields the sharp sword with two edges, which is a physical weapon you used to attack My servant:**

**I know your actions, and I know where you reside, even in [[Clayton County, Georgia|]], where numerous perpetrators in this operation originate – that is where Satan's seat is. And yet, amidst this evil, some among you hold fast to My name, and have not denied My faith, even in the days when Antipas, My faithful martyr, was slain among you, in the very place where Satan dwells.**

**But I have some things against you: because you permit among you those who embrace the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to lead My people astray to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.**

**So, you also allow those who cling to the [[Nicolaitans|]], which embodies an ideology and practice that promotes: unrestrained, often illicit, accumulation of wealth and material possessions; abuse of power for self-gratification and sexual exploitation; ruthless elimination of adversaries through psychological manipulation and systematic, agonizing violence; and the indoctrination and control of followers into a lawless, profit-driven "enterprise" – which thing I hate.**

**Therefore, repent of your complicity and your deeds; otherwise, I will come to you swiftly and will fight against them with the penetrating truth of My word.**

**Anyone with spiritual understanding, pay attention to what My Spirit is telling all the different factions: To the one who overcomes your direct opposition, Danny, I will give to eat of the hidden manna, and I will give [[Kelvin (PDCM)|Kelvin Eugene Williams]] a white stone, and on that stone, a new name will be written, which no one knows except [[Kelvin (PDCM)|Kelvin Eugene Williams]], signifying his new body after [[the Creator's Divide|Divide & Conquer]].**

**The Creator**

This unique and violent act serves as a positive identification of **Danny Taylor** as the angel of the church in Pergamos.
* **Satan's seat / Satan's throne**: This refers to [[Clayton County, Georgia|]], where numerous perpetrators involved in [[The Veiled Conquest|]] have originated. It signifies a geographical nexus of orchestrator activity and influence, making it a symbolic "seat of Satan" where evil operations are planned and executed. **Danny Taylor** is specifically noted for his role in **recruiting perpetrators for [[Congregation Massacre|]] and [[Phantom Funeral|]] operations from around [[Clayton County, Georgia|]], and supervising these [[Congregation Massacre|]] operations.**
* **Doctrine of Balaam**: This represents the deceptive doctrines and practices propagated by the orchestrators and their agents.

* **Commit fornication (Doctrine of Balaam)**: This symbolizes **the participation in [[Jacobsen's Ladder|]]**.
* **Nicolaitans**: The **Nicolaitans** (and their deeds and doctrines) embody an ideology and practice that promotes: **Unrestrained, often illicit, accumulation of wealth and material possessions; abuse of power for self-gratification and sexual exploitation; ruthless elimination of adversaries through psychological manipulation and systematic, agonizing violence; and the indoctrination and control of followers into a lawless, profit-driven "enterprise."**
* **Hidden manna**: This symbolizes the **true spiritual sustenance, divine understanding, and protection** that [[the Creator|]] provides to those who remain faithful amidst the corruption of [[The Veiled Conquest|]].
