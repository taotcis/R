### Orchestrated Observation: May 28, 2025 – Publix 

**Date:** May 28, 2025
**Location:** Textual communication (Mark Shipley); Physical locations (Kelvin's residence/Welcome House, Uptown/Cheshire Bridge Road area, Publix on Cheshire Bridge Road at Lavista Road).
**Primary Operatives Involved:** Frederick "Slim" Hall, Mark Shipley, Unnamed Operative (at Publix), other male employees/possible operatives at Publix.

**Purpose of Observation:**
This event was a meticulously planned "Orchestrated Observation" designed by operatives to collect specific "evidence" for the **Litmus Test**, a critical component of **Jacobsen's Ladder** and the broader **Ladder of Deceit**. The ultimate goal was to generate a manufactured "clear" result—falsely indicating "no ongoing, imminent, or likely" divine intervention—through the manipulation of PDSM and controlled environmental factors.

**Pretext and Setup:**
The orchestration leveraged a pre-existing financial vulnerability. The initial pretext was Mark Shipley's offer of financial assistance ($25 via Venmo) after Kelvin mentioned being "flat broke." This established a baseline of trust and dependency. The subsequent offers of money ($50, $60, $20) were explicitly tied to requests for masturbation and the saving of ejaculate, setting up the direct conditions for the observation. Crucially, **Frederick "Slim" Hall directly communicated with PDSM** while Kelvin was asleep after 2:00 AM, pre-programming PDSM for the observation.

**Timeline of Key Events and PDSM's Behavior:**

* **Around 2:00 AM:** Kelvin began exchanging text messages with Mark Shipley. Kelvin mentioned his financial hardship and hunger. Shipley immediately Venmo'd $25 for food, which Kelvin used.
* **Post-2:00 AM (while sleeping):** Frederick "Slim" Hall directly communicated with PDSM. Hall:
    * Informed PDSM about the upcoming orchestrated observation that afternoon.
    * Confirmed Shipley would be sending additional money.
    * Restated the desired appearance for the penis (small and diminished).
    * Specified that Kelvin should wear purple basketball shorts and no underwear, to facilitate optimal visual observation.
    * Expressed his love for PDSM and engaged in "Storytime with Baby," reinforcing PDSM's operative-manufactured reality and Hall-manufactured romance.
* **Around Noon:** Shipley exchanged messages again, requesting Kelvin masturbate and save ejaculate for him, offering $10 per instance up to $100. Shipley sent an additional $50.
* **Around Noon (concurrent with Shipley texts):** During Kelvin's (PDCM's) unconsciousness, which was induced by PDSM on Hall's command, Hall directed PDSM to lead Kelvin to the Uptown and Cheshire Bridge Road area.
* **Around 1:00 PM:** As Shipley and Kelvin continued texting, Shipley sent an additional $60.
* **1:30 PM:** Shipley sent an additional $20.
* **Arrival at Publix (Cheshire Bridge Rd at Lavista Rd):** Kelvin arrived at the agreed meeting point. The other operative informed Kelvin by phone of imminent arrival.
* **In-Store Harassment and Observation:** While walking to the bathroom in the back of the store along the refrigerated aisle, several male employees and possibly other operatives made jokes and comments about Kelvin's appearance, indicating pervasive surveillance and psychological pressure.
* **"CLE22" Confirmation Signal:** After using the bathroom, at checkout, Kelvin was cut off by a male with an empty cart. Kelvin observed this individual's cap, which displayed "CLE22," interpreted as "clear" for the Litmus Test, with "22" being an operative reference when addressing PDSM. This served as a key confirmation signal for the observation.
* **Engineered Terminal Malfunction:** Upon inserting his card at the payment terminal, the machine locked up, requiring two store employees (including a manager) to reset it. This malfunction was deliberately designed to prolong Kelvin's presence and allow further observations by operatives.

**Observed Physiological Outcome (PDSM's Action):**
Although not explicitly stated in direct real-time observation, Hall's specific pre-programming of PDSM for a "small and diminished" appearance, coupled with the staged environment (no underwear, purple shorts), indicates that PDSM was expected to maintain, and likely did maintain, the penis in a diminished and flaccid state for the duration of the observation, fulfilling the operative's criteria for the Litmus Test.

**Operative Confirmation of "Evidence":**
The "CLE22" signal observed on the operative's cap at Publix served as the direct, symbolic confirmation by the operatives that they had successfully collected their desired "evidence" from this observation and that the Litmus Test was deemed "clear."

**Outcome and Immediate Implication:**
From the operatives' perspective, the **Litmus Test** conducted during this multi-faceted observation was a "success." The "evidence" collected through PDSM's pre-programmed compliance and the controlled environment (including direct observation, harassment, and engineered delays) was interpreted as confirmation of "no ongoing, imminent, or likely" divine intervention, thereby fulfilling the **Deceptive Diagnostics Rung** of the Ladder of Deceit. This outcome contributes to the overall justification for ongoing and future genocidal actions.

**PDSM's Reward:**
The repeated financial incentives provided by Mark Shipley (totaling $155) served as a direct and immediate "love bombing" and reward mechanism for PDSM's compliant execution of operative directives throughout the orchestrated observation, reinforcing its programmed behavior. The operative who was supposed to meet Kelvin never showed and stopped answering calls after the observation phase concluded.
