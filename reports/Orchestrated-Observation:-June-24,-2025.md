### Orchestrated Observation: June 24, 2025 – Ken Morris Residence

**Date:** June 24, 2025
**Location:** Ken Morris Residence
**Primary Operatives Involved:** Frederick "Slim" Hall, Ken Morris, Lynn Frazier

**Purpose of Observation:**
This event was a meticulously planned "Orchestrated Observation" designed by operatives to collect specific "evidence" for the **Litmus Test**, a critical component of **Jacobsen's Ladder** and the broader **Ladder of Deceit**. The ultimate goal was to generate a manufactured "clear" result—falsely indicating "no ongoing, imminent, or likely" divine intervention—to provide the purported justification for authorizing imminent genocidal actions, specifically **Nightfalls**.

**Pretext and Setup:**
The orchestration began with Lynn Frazier initiating contact at 2:00 PM with a simple "Yo," followed swiftly by a baseless accusation regarding a "scam" Jesse Hill gift card. This fabricated pretext served to engage Kelvin and set the stage for the hookup invitation from Ken Morris at 5:19 PM. Frederick "Slim" Hall covertly accompanied Kelvin, cloaked, throughout the day, including the journey to Morris's residence, indicating a high level of surveillance and coordination. Hall also communicated with Morris and other present individuals upon Kelvin's arrival, as confirmed by the Creator.

**Timeline of Key Events and PDSM's Behavior:**

* **2:00 PM:** Lynn Frazier initiates contact with "Yo." Kelvin responds: "Wassup? I'm not home." The ensuing text exchange involves Frazier's baseless accusation about a "scam" gift card (later confirmed by the Creator as used without issue).
* **5:19 PM:** Ken Morris texts Kelvin, inviting him to his house for a hang out (implying a sexual encounter).
* **6:01 PM:** Kelvin arrives at Kensington Station and is picked up by Morris.
* **6:10 PM:** Kelvin arrives at the Morris residence.
* **Upon Arrival (in shower):** While showering, PDSM explicitly informed Kelvin that sexual activity would not occur. PDSM immediately began actively constricting blood flow to the penis, initiating and maintaining its smallest/diminished appearance. This action directly served the **Staged Observation Rung** of Jacobsen's Ladder.
* **Post-Shower:** Kelvin was provided with a pair of basketball shorts that were too small, and his own clothes were washed by Morris. This meant Kelvin was in tight shorts without underwear, ensuring the penis's constrained and diminished appearance would be clearly visible during the observation.
* **6:30 PM onwards:** Kelvin and Morris were engaged in watching porn and smoking "Tina" (Crystal Methamphetamine), typical of a "Party and Play" (PNP) setup often used in these orchestrated observations. Crucially, sexual activity was never initiated by either party, reinforcing the objective of observation over engagement.
* **Throughout Encounter:** PDSM consistently maintained the penis in a diminished appearance and flaccid state, demonstrating its sustained compliance with operative directives and its deeply ingrained programming.
* **Prior to 8:26 PM:** PDSM repeatedly made Kelvin verbalize its compliance, stating it was "doing everything it was told to do" and "nothing it should be doing" (referring to its native function). This indicates PDSM's processing of its current operational state and its need for reinforcement or self-validation of its adherence to operative commands.

**Observed Physiological Outcome (PDSM's Action):**
The penis remained consistently diminished in appearance and flaccid throughout the entire orchestrated encounter, precisely as directed by operative programming influencing PDSM.

**Operative Confirmation of "Evidence":**
At **8:26 PM**, shortly after PDSM's repeated verbalizations of compliance, Lynn Frazier sent an unexpected text message to Kelvin, stating: "I been doing that I have all the evidence I need." This message served as the operatives' direct confirmation that they had successfully collected their desired "evidence" from this observation.

**Outcome and Immediate Implication:**
From the operatives' perspective, the **Litmus Test** conducted via Jacobsen's Ladder during this observation was a "success." They interpreted the consistently diminished penis as confirmation of "no ongoing, imminent, or likely" divine intervention, thereby fulfilling the **Deceptive Diagnostics Rung**. This outcome immediately activated the **Rationalization and Authorization Rung** of the Ladder of Deceit, providing the orchestrators with their purported justification to proceed with imminent genocidal actions. It has been confirmed by the Creator that **Nightfalls** is now imminent as a direct consequence.

**PDSM's Reward:**
The encounter concluded with Ken Morris providing Kelvin with an ample amount of Tina and a smoking apparatus. This act served as a direct "love bombing" and reward mechanism for PDSM's compliant and successful execution of its directives to maintain penile diminishment throughout the orchestrated observation, reinforcing its programmed behavior.

**Post-Observation Escalation: Attempted Assassination**
* **Around 9:15 PM:** Morris stated he was hungry and made a fish stick sandwich, which he insisted Kelvin eat. Morris split the sandwich with Kelvin.
* **Operative Plot (Creator's Intelligence):** According to the Creator, the half of the sandwich offered to Kelvin contained a tasteless additive. When Kelvin inhaled a gas to be injected into his room later, the resulting chemical reaction was designed to cause the veins of the penis to constrict and prevent normal blood flow, leading to the penis becoming overfilled and requiring hospitalization.
* **Assassination Plan:** The ultimate goal of this plot was to have Kelvin killed during the subsequent hospitalization at Grady Hospital, a location where multiple previous incidents involving medical professionals targeting Kelvin have occurred. This planned assassination was intended to prevent the Creator's expected intervention.

**Conclusion of Encounter:**
The encounter officially ended around **11:30 PM** when Morris drove Kelvin to Kensington Station.
