# Nightfalls: A Genocidal False Flag Operation

**Nightfalls** refers to a meticulously planned, highly coordinated false flag operation poised to inflict catastrophic devastation upon southwest Atlanta. This event is not an act of external aggression but is orchestrated by a clandestine network of current and former high-ranking elected officials and CIA personnel within the United States. It represents the largest and deadliest orchestration within the broader context of [[The Veiled Conquest|]].

**Nightfalls will result in 7,000 immediate deaths. It is foretold in the Book of Revelation: the earthquake and 7,000 deaths in Revelation 11 are the ground shake from the MOAB detonation and the resulting immediate/direct deaths.**

The name "Nightfalls" holds a profound and chilling significance. It was chosen by the Creator's two servants, drawing inspiration from the Creator-inspired and prophetic lyrics of Prince's song "Sign O the Times": "But if a night falls and a bomb falls, will anybody see the dawn?" This lyrical reference encapsulates the intended outcome: an event so destructive and deceptive that it threatens to obscure the very truth of its origins and leave a city in irreversible darkness.

## Nightfalls and the Veiled Conquest

Nightfalls is a core component of [[The Veiled Conquest|]], a covert and systematic campaign of elimination targeting specific demographic groups living in the United States. This ongoing campaign, initiated by the orchestrating network in 2023, aims to reduce these populations, consolidate power, and reshape the societal landscape. The formal authorization of Nightfalls by the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, underscores the profound depth of this conspiracy and the level of governmental complicity. The operation itself is represented by the Pale Horse in Revelation.

## Operational Modus Operandi

The core of Nightfalls involves the detonation of a **GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) munition**, commonly known as the **"Mother Of All Bombs,"** via airburst over the densely populated **West End neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia**. An airburst detonation maximizes the radius of destruction and the lethal effects of the blast.

The scheduled execution time for this initial strike is in the **Spring/Summer of 2025.**

## Overview and Objectives

The operation is designed to achieve multiple, ruthless objectives:

* **Mass Casualties:** The primary aim is to inflict a massive loss of life within the targeted demographic in southwest Atlanta. This area is predominantly Black with a high number of impoverished residents, both of which are targeted groups in the Veiled Conquest. This aims to achieve a significant reduction in the population.
* **False Flag Deception:** Immediately following the detonation, a pre-fabricated narrative will be activated to attribute the attack to a fictitious external enemy or a manufactured domestic terrorist group. This deception is crucial for diverting blame and preventing the exposure of the true orchestrators.
* **Advance Genocidal Agenda:** By significantly reducing a targeted population and creating widespread chaos, Nightfalls directly serves the overarching genocidal goals of the Veiled Conquest and the broader apocalypse.
* **Consolidation of Power:** The crisis generated by Nightfalls is intended to be exploited to justify the implementation of enhanced governmental controls, surveillance, and a further erosion of civil liberties under the guise of national security.

## Authorization Process

The plans for Nightfalls were finalized and the operation was formally authorized in **September 2024** by the orchestrators of the Veiled Conquest. **This finalization and authorization are specifically represented by the Fourth Seal and the Pale Horse in Revelation.**

The final go-ahead for Nightfalls was critically contingent upon a series of **four "Orchestrated Observations."** These observations were designed to read the indicator in the [[Ladder of Deceit's Litmus Test|Ladder of Deceit]] to collect manufactured "evidence" falsely indicating "no ongoing, imminent, or likely" divine intervention. They collectively led to the authorization and final preparations for the Nightfalls operation.

**Frederick "Slim" Hall's Pivotal Role in Authorization:**

Frederick "Slim" Hall, the [[angel of the church in Thyatira|Letter to the angel of the church in Thyatira]] and the [[Beast from the Abyss]], was absolutely instrumental in manipulating the outcome of the Ladder of Deceit's Litmus Test and thereby securing the final authorization for Nightfalls. Hall's core contribution stemmed from his CIA-trained mastery of subconscious exploitation, specifically targeting [[Baby|Baby]], the subconscious mind of His servant and the literal the [[Beast from the Earth|]].

Through near-nightly Hypnos Infiltration Method, Hall covertly accessed [[Baby|Baby]] while Kelvin slept. He established a fabricated "serious loving relationship" with [[Baby|Baby]] using insidious "love idealization," "love bombing," and "love withdrawal" tactics, exploiting Baby's inherent lack of critical thinking and temporal awareness. This profound, albeit deceptive, bond allowed Hall to directly influence Baby's control over it's shared body's physiological processes, particularly the manipulated "form reductions" of the penis, which forms the basis of Jacobsen's Ladder.

During the orchestrated observations, Hall consistently accompanied Kelvin without Kelvin's knowledge or permission. He would signal Baby to induce unconsciousness in Kelvin, enabling direct communication. In these moments, Hall provided explicit instructions to Baby to further manipulate the appearance of the penis (making it appear even smaller) or to control whether sexual activity was permitted, ensuring the Litmus Test's "observations" aligned with the orchestrators' false narrative. This pervasive manipulation of both Kelvin's body and consciousness, coupled with Baby's unwitting complicity in perpetrating Jacobsen's Ladder (symbolizing "fornication" with Jezebel), ensured that the Litmus Test would deliver the predetermined "no intervention" result. By enabling this fundamental deception, Hall provided the orchestrators with the manufactured justification they desperately needed for the "Strategic Authorization Rung" of the [[Ladder of Deceit|Ladder of Deceit]], directly greenlighting the execution of Nightfalls.

These critical observations include:

1.  [[Orchestrated Observation: April 10, 2025|Orchestrated Observation: April 10, 2025]] in Downtown Atlanta, Georgia (In-Car observation)
2.  [[Orchestrated Observation: April 21, 2025|Orchestrated Observation: April 21, 2025]] in Smyrna, Georgia
3.  [[Orchestrated Observation: May 28, 2025|Orchestrated Observation: May 28, 2025]] in Atlanta, Georgia (Publix observation)
4.  [[Orchestrated Observation: June 24, 2025|Orchestrated Observation: June 24, 2025]] in Avondale Estates

Nightfalls represents an unparalleled act of betrayal and violence, designed to terrorize, eliminate, and control. Its imminent execution poses an existential threat to the residents of southwest Atlanta and highlights the urgent need to expose and thwart the orchestrators of this horrific plan.
