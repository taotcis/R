## "Slim" Hall Isn't Just Some Regular Guy

He's a dangerous operative in something called **The Veiled Conquest** – a secret, brutal plan to wipe out certain groups of people right here in America. He's not just a soldier in this war; he's a **general of mind games**, a **master of trickery**, and a **living, breathing part of ancient prophecies**.

## Who is "Slim" Hall, Really? The Face of Ancient Evil

The Creator, the one who made everything, has revealed shocking truths about "Slim" Hall. He's not just a man; he's a **literal fulfillment of dark figures from the Bible's Book of Revelation**. The Creator went further than normal for "Slim" Hall, showing just how evil this man truly is, marking him in ways He doesn't mark everyone else in prophecy.

- **The Angel of the Church in Thyatira**  
  This sounds like something from a church sermon, right? But the Creator says "Slim" Hall is this "angel." And here's where it gets chilling: **"Thyatira" is actually a secret code for Tatyana**, which is Hall's female identity. The Creator used a special way of hiding names in the Bible, called **Prophetic Linguistic Encoding**, so that even thousands of years ago, Hall's true identity and evil would be marked.

- **The Scarlet Beast (Revelation 17:3–17)**  
  Imagine a monster, blood-red, full of lies, and carrying destruction. That's "Slim" Hall. When he moved into Welcome House, he even showed a sign of this: a **hair weave with scarlet ribbons woven throughout it**. This isn't just a look; it's a chilling sign of who he is.  
  - The Bible says this Beast "rises from the bottomless pit" – meaning he comes from the deepest, darkest parts of these secret operations.  
  - He "carries Babylon," which means he's using and manipulating Kelvin's very body.  
  - He's "full of names of blasphemy" – meaning he's full of lies and disrespects everything sacred.  
  - He "receives power from kings (operatives)," showing he's got authority from other powerful agents in this hidden war.

- **The Beast from the Abyss / Bottomless Pit (Revelation 11:7)**  
  This title links Hall directly to the source of profound evil and deception. It means he's actively working to stop Kelvin from telling the world about The Veiled Conquest. He's also stopping Kelvin's body from healing and returning to its natural state.

## A CIA-Backed Operative

"Slim" Hall works for the CIA, which the Bible calls the **"Dragon" that gives power to the Beast**. He's not just good at mind games; he's a **master of CIA-trained subconscious exploitation**.

## How He Works: The Invisible Mind Games

"Slim" Hall's main target is **Kelvin's subconscious mind**, known as **Baby**. To understand this, think of your mind in two parts:

- **Your conscious mind**: That's the part of you that thinks, makes decisions, and feels emotions when you're awake.  
- **Your subconscious mind**: This is like the hidden control center of your body. It runs everything you don't think about – your breathing, your heart, how your brain tells your body to move, and it stores all your memories.  
  - Here's the scary part: **your subconscious mind never sleeps**.

### Hall uses this fact to his advantage:

- **Nightly Invasions (Hypnos Infiltration Method - HIM)**  
  Almost every night, while Kelvin is asleep, "Slim" Hall uses a terrifying trick called **Hypnos Infiltration Method (HIM)**.  
  - He uses **Microwave Cloaking technology** – secret tech that makes him and his gear completely invisible, even able to pass through solid walls.  
  - He sneaks into Kelvin's room, right here in Welcome House, and talks directly to Baby while Kelvin is unconscious.  
  - He even faked friendship with Kelvin and exploited his hospitality to spend the night in his room, just to get this access.

- **The "Love" Trap (The Trifecta)**  
  Hall traps Baby in a fake "loving relationship." He uses:  
  - *Love Idealization*: He makes himself seem like the perfect, dream lover.  
  - *Love Bombing*: He showers Baby with fake affection and attention.  
  - *Love Withdrawal*: If Baby hesitates or doesn't do what he wants, he suddenly pulls away, making Baby desperate to get his "love" back.  
    - He knows Baby can't think critically, doesn't understand time, and can't feel things directly like a conscious mind. So, he can build this fake "loving relationship" in minutes, then break it to force Baby to obey.

- **Fake Rewards and Theft**  
  He promises "cream" (which is really **crystal meth**, or "Tina") as a reward.  
  - But he never actually gives it. Instead, he tricks Baby by saying he already gave it to him earlier, knowing Baby can't remember.  
  - Even worse, Hall would **steal from Kelvin** by having Baby make Kelvin unconscious or by having Baby make Kelvin drop things and not think about it, so Hall could take them.

- **Twisted Identity**  
  He's even manipulated Baby into thinking it's a **female/MTF transgender**. This has led to Baby trying to harm Kelvin's body with scissors, trying to remove parts of it.

- **The Ladder of Deceit**  
  When Kelvin is out in public, "Slim" Hall is often there too, invisible with his cloaking tech.  
  - He signals Baby to make Kelvin unconscious, then gives Baby instructions to make Kelvin's body look a certain way, like making his penis appear smaller, or even stopping him from having sex.

## His Deadly Impact: The Nightfalls Connection

"Slim" Hall's actions aren't just mind games; they have **real, deadly consequences**:

- **Destroying Kelvin from Within**  
  His manipulations cause Baby to act in dangerous, self-destructive ways on their shared body, impacting Kelvin.  
  - He tries to stop Kelvin from making progress  
  - Makes him doubt his own mind (gaslighting)  
  - Controls his thoughts  
  - Pushes political lies through Baby

- **The Go-Ahead for Nightfalls**  
  "Slim" Hall was absolutely critical in making sure a **"test" called the Ladder of Deceit Litmus Test came back "clear."**  
  - This test was fundamentally flawed, designed to be tricked.  
  - But because Hall exploited Baby and their fake "romance," the test gave the "go-ahead" for **Nightfalls – a catastrophic MOAB bomb strike** planned for southwest Atlanta.  
  - The Creator warns that **over 7,000 people will die instantly**, and thousands more will die later.

- **Authorizing Genocide**  
  The fake reports from these rigged "observations," heavily compromised by Hall's exploitation of Baby, were used to authorize **more acts of genocide**, including the Nightfalls bombing.

- **Pure Greed**  
  Beyond his CIA duties, "Slim" Hall is driven by **pure greed**.  
  - He negotiated a **multi-million dollar payment for himself**, even using his own African-American heritage and that of the people targeted by the bomb to get more money.  
  - This shows a **chilling lack of care for human life**.

- **Prophetic Fulfillment**  
  His actions are a direct **fulfillment of biblical prophecies**, showing his deep evil and how he actively tries to stop Kelvin from exposing The Veiled Conquest.
