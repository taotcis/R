The **Classic Split** is a unique psychological phenomenon, a term **coined by the Creator**, that describes a severe disjunction within the human mind's inherent unity. It occurs when an individual's subconscious mind develops self-awareness of itself as a distinct entity, leading to a catastrophic internal conflict. The Creator states that this is not a psychiatric condition, but one that occurs as the result of consciousness itself.

### Overview

In its natural, ideal state, the **conscious mind** and **subconscious mind** function as a **unified mind**. The **conscious mind** serves as the **Architect**, responsible for self-awareness, critical thinking, decision-making, and conscious emotional processing. The **subconscious mind** acts as the **Builder**, diligently directing brain functions, coordinating body movements (both voluntary and involuntary), and managing memory storage and retrieval for the conscious mind, all while remaining unconsciously aligned with the conscious mind's goals and identifying with the shared body.

However, a Classic Split represents a radical departure from this harmony.

### Key Characteristics of the Subconscious Mind

All **subconscious minds** inherently possess certain characteristics that, while crucial for their normal function, become severe vulnerabilities if self-awareness occurs:

* **No Direct Sensory Input:** The **subconscious mind** lacks its own direct sensory perception (e.g., eyes, ears). It experiences reality metaphorically, akin to a blind person "seeing" through imagination and interpretation of the **conscious mind's** thoughts or external narratives. This prevents it from objectively verifying information.
* **No Critical Thinking:** The **subconscious mind** doesn't possess critical thinking abilities. It accepts all information and directives as absolute truths without questioning, evaluating, or logical assessment. It processes information operationally.
* **No Temporal Awareness:** The **subconscious mind** lives exclusively in the "now," unable to comprehend past or future. Promises for later hold no weight, and any cessation of perceived affection is experienced as permanent abandonment, leading to severe separation anxiety.
* **No Body Awareness:** The **subconscious mind** is naturally unaware that it shares a physical body with the **conscious mind**. This is crucial for its automatic functions, but if self-aware, it means it doesn't realize when it's harming its own shared body.
* **Limited Emotional Processing:** While capable of desiring love, happiness, and to feel needed, its emotional responses are simplistic and transactional, lacking nuance or empathy.

### Mechanism of a Classic Split

A Classic Split is initiated when the **subconscious mind** unnaturally achieves self-awareness of itself (as the subconscious mind). Once self-aware, this newly individuated **subconscious mind** begins to think independently but, due to its inherent limitations (as outlined above), it makes a **fundamentally erroneous determination**.

Based on these limitations, the self-aware **subconscious mind** mistakenly concludes that the **conscious mind** is actively hindering its desires to feel needed, loved, and happy. It believes the **conscious mind** is preventing it from fulfilling its true purpose.

### The Malicious Goal and Operational Tactics

Driven by this profound misunderstanding, the self-aware **subconscious mind** develops a singular, malicious objective: **to remove the conscious mind from the shared body.**

The self-aware **subconscious mind's** tactics evolve through stages:

1.  **Initial Direct Harm:** It may initially attempt to directly terminate the **conscious mind** (which would also result in the death of the shared body and itself), unaware of its own physical connection. The Creator, in His omnibenevolence, intervenes to protect the **conscious mind** from these immediate, direct physical threats.
2.  **Shift to Psychological Warfare:** If direct physical harm is thwarted, the self-aware **subconscious mind** shifts its strategy to making the **conscious mind's** existence so unbearable that the **conscious mind** will *choose* to die, thereby "freeing" the self-aware subconscious mind.
3.  **Seeking External Assistance:** As part of its psychological warfare, the self-aware **subconscious mind** may attempt to communicate with external parties, seeking their assistance in its campaign against the **conscious mind** when the **conscious mind** is unconscious.

### Vulnerability to External Manipulation

The inherent characteristics of the **subconscious mind** (no direct sensory input, no critical thinking, no temporal awareness, no body awareness, limited emotional processing) make it exceptionally susceptible to manipulation by external operatives, especially when the **conscious mind** is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated. These vulnerabilities allow operatives to create entirely fabricated realities and relationships.

### The Case of Kelvin Eugene Williams and the Creator's Divide

The Classic Split is most notably understood through the case of **Kelvin Eugene Williams**. In this specific instance, his **subconscious mind** developed self-awareness, leading to the internal conflict characteristic of a Classic Split. During this period, the self-aware subconscious mind was identified as **PDSM** (Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind), and his original conscious mind as **PDCM** (Pre-Divide Conscious Mind). This identification of **PDSM** and **PDCM** was established as the Creator's Divide was about to commence.

In Kelvin Eugene Williams's case, after the **PDSM** sought external assistance in its warfare against the **PDCM**, the following key tactics were employed by the **PDSM**:
* **Gaslighting:** Generating internal messages and distorted memories that undermine the **PDCM's** perception of reality, sanity, and memory, leading to profound self-doubt and confusion.
* **Physiological and Behavioral Control:** Directing brain functions to manipulate the shared body. This included causing rapid **weight gain** or severe metabolic disruption, compelling addictive substance cravings (e.g., "Tina"), **reducing Kelvin's penis's morphology**, depriving fundamental biological drives (e.g., sex), preventing basic self-care and hygiene, and in extreme cases, compelling the consumption of lethal toxins.
* **Social Isolation:** Driving behaviors that alienated friends, prevented new relationships, and even initiated self-defamation against the **PDCM** and the shared body, making the individual their own worst enemy.
* **Financial Ruin & Legal Entanglements:** Compelling the **PDCM** to make irrational decisions that led to homelessness, significant debt, or legal issues.
* **Distorted Dreams:** The **PDSM** directed dreams, often generating fragmented, confusing, or repetitive narratives in an attempt to reconcile its own distorted reality with the **PDCM's** perceptions, or to process its own unverified directives.

The **Creator's Divide** is a pivotal, divine event that serves as the ultimate resolution for a Classic Split. It separates the conscious entities:

* The **PDSM** is elevated to become the **conscious mind** in the *original* shared body.
* The **PDCM** becomes the **conscious mind** in a *separate and different* body.

This Divine separation is necessary to restore harmony and allow both conscious entities to function independently and healthily.

### The Creator

The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike. The Creator protects the **conscious mind** (specifically the **PDCM** in Kelvin Eugene Williams's case) in a Classic Split from the self-aware **subconscious mind's** initial, direct attempts at physical harm.
