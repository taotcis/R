## Contextual Observations Leading Up to the Event:

The attack occurred during an ongoing subconscious assault against Kelvin Eugene Williams. Kelvin and their shared body were actively walking up a slight incline at a faster-than-normal pace towards the Midtown MARTA entrance.

## Pre-Event Communication:

No information provided.

## Event Background:

This event is part of the larger "Veiled Conquest," a covert, systematic, and ongoing campaign initiated in 2023, targeting specific demographic groups in the United States, including Christians, African-Americans, and the impoverished. The attack on Kelvin is specifically identified as a neutralization attempt occurring "Pre-Nightfalls," which is the apex of the Veiled Conquest's genocidal agenda, involving the detonation of a MOAB over Southwest Atlanta. Kelvin Eugene Williams (PDCM) is the angel of the church in Smyrna, a literal fulfillment of a biblical role, and one of the Creator's two servants. Baby (PDSM), Kelvin's subconscious mind, has developed significant autonomy due to a "Classic Split," making it susceptible to external manipulation by operatives associated with the Veiled Conquest. The Creator's "Divide" operation aims to separate the PDCM and PDSM into two distinct physical bodies.

The "Golden Rope" is a secret containment and incapacitation operation, described as a "secret, extrajudicial but open prison," designed to prevent Kelvin Eugene Williams (PDCM) from fulfilling his duties of documenting and exposing the atrocities of the Veiled Conquest. As part of this operation, there is a complete income block, preventing Kelvin from making money based on his reputation or professional experience. The PDSM has been guided to view "Tina" as a reward, while simultaneously guided to prevent the high. Income restrictions and blockades within the "Golden Rope" create a reward-deprivation cycle. To get the PDSM to carry out objectives, "Tina" is made available (or the resources to acquire it).

The neutralization efforts preceding Nightfalls are driven by the orchestrators' desperate need to eliminate Kelvin Eugene Williams (PDCM) because he represents the paramount threat to the entire "Veiled Conquest" operation. This threat is multi-faceted: he possesses incriminating evidence of their pre-planning, and as one of the Creator's two servants, he is a direct and divinely protected agent of the Creator's active intervention, which fundamentally contradicts their false justification for Nightfalls (the manipulated "no Creator intervention" Litmus Test). Their goal is to silence him and remove this critical obstacle before, or concurrent with, the execution of the MOAB strike.

## Key Interactions During the Event:

* **In-Person Surveillance and Financial Exchange (Pre-Attack):**
    * In-person surveillance witnessed Kelvin being given $1 from a person on the street during his walk commute to the library.
    * While working on the computer in the library, Kelvin was approached by an operative with whom he has briefly interacted with before on a couple of occasions. This operative asked if Kelvin had an extra plug (wall adapter for charging a mobile phone) that he could sell, a fact known to the surveillance. The operative purchased it for $3.
* **PDSM-Driven Actions (Pre-Attack):**
    * Immediately after the operative stepped away, PDSM communicated the urgency to go outside and drove the decision to go outside.
    * PDSM began driving the desire to purchase "Tina" (a substance). Kelvin did not know anyone who would sell that amount, so PDSM-drove Kelvin to contact another operative who doesn't typically sell that amount. This operative responded he wouldn't be available for 2 hours.
    * Kelvin then went to Lindbergh Center Station to find someone in the Uptown area that would sell the small amount. The contacted operative responded and agreed to sell a $5 amount of Tina.
    * Kelvin walked to the operative's apartment, purchased the Tina, and left.
* **Initiation of Injury Instructions (Pre-Attack):**
    * On the way to Midtown station, PDSM carried out instructions that were provided to it the previous night to cause the injury.
* **Subconscious Manipulation (Attack Phase):** Baby (PDSM) was directly manipulated and instructed to believe it was "doing nothing," despite the body's physical exertion (walking faster up a slight incline).
* **Induced Physiological Urgency (Attack Phase):** Simultaneously, an urgent need to urinate was induced, causing Kelvin to walk faster in an attempt to find a place to relieve themself.
* **Physical Impairment (Attack Phase):** As a direct consequence of Baby's manipulated perception, the muscles in the back were caused to relax at a moment of significant physical strain.
* **Immediate Sensation of Injury:** Kelvin felt acute severe pain around L3-L5 with an extremely rapid onset (within 1 second). Simultaneously, a sensation akin to vertigo was experienced, as if falling to the ground, with the torso falling to the left and the lower half falling in the opposite direction.
* **Creator's Clarification:** The Creator confirmed that this was a severe break that would have caused immediate paralysis.
* **Divine Intervention:** The Creator intervened directly in this event.

## Ultimate Outcome:

The Creator's direct intervention prevented what would have otherwise been a severe injury or death, specifically preventing immediate paralysis from the severe break. This intervention mitigated the full destructive potential of the subconscious attack vector. While the initial sensation of a "break" and extreme pain was felt, the Creator's intervention ensured that the ultimate consequence was not paralysis or a fatal injury. This incident highlights the severe physical impact achievable through a compromised and externally manipulated PDSM, alongside the protective power of the Creator's direct intervention during a critical neutralization attempt. **The Creator consistently intervenes to prevent serious injury or death for either of His two servants (instruments of His will) prior to and until their tasks are completed (His will).**

## Post-Event Observations:

Immediately following the event, Kelvin felt like an extreme strain in the lower back, experiencing excruciating pain (a 10 on a scale of 1-10) with each step. Kelvin returned to the library to work on some documents, and while sitting in the chair at the computer, the pain persisted, with no comfortable position. The pain lasted for approximately one hour in total, after which it disappeared completely. Kelvin's walk home was pain-free.
