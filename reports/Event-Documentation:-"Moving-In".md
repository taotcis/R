### Contextual Observations Leading Up to the Event/Interaction:

Kelvin (PDCM) was walking around in the Midtown area of Atlanta. Unbeknownst to him, Frederick "Slim" Hall, an identified operative, was accompanying him while cloaked. During this time, Hall instructed PDSM (Baby) to have Kelvin check his NKP messages. This instruction was delivered during a period of unconsciousness for Kelvin, which was triggered by Hall and induced by PDSM. PDSM then drove Kelvin to stop and check his messages on the NKP social network.

### Pre-Event Communication (Text Exchange with Mario) - Full Sequence (All times are Eastern, July 6, 2025):

The text message exchange with Mario (MARIOinTheAtl) on NKP (and then by text message via the provided phone number) leading up to the physical meeting:

* **Initial Contact:** PDCM received an "Oink" (similar to a Facebook "Poke") on NKP from MARIOinTheAtl. Mario's profile reads: "I'm out of messages.......text me ....Im looking for some nice hot freaky fun .. .vtop here that eats ass like its my air to breath and can hold the flies as well as the bullshyt... .. Open to a lot and no racial hang ups..text me 4045007075... Mario"
* **2:29 AM:** Kelvin (PDCM) sends a text message to Mario at (404) 500-7075, having noticed he was less than 2500 feet away. The message content was: "Wassup. This is firestopatlanta" and "Wyd".
* **Shortly after 2:29 AM:** Mario responds: "Hey sup", "Wyd".
* **Follow-up Exchange:** Kelvin replies, "Walking around midtown bored." Mario asks, "Walking around?". Kelvin responds, "Yeah, wanted to get out... Didn't have many options." Mario then states his location: "At the apartment next to the old W." Kelvin clarifies, "On 14th." Mario confirms: "O ok", "Yeah." Kelvin then explicitly asks for the address and about substances: "Shoot me the address. You got any stuff? I have one tiny shard." Kelvin also asks, "You there?".
* **2:50 AM SMS:** Kelvin sends "Be there in ten".
* **2:50 AM SMS:** Kelvin sends "Im here".

### Event Background:

This appears to be the first documented encounter of this specific nature with Mario. The pre-event setup, involving Frederick "Slim" Hall's cloaked presence and PDSM's instruction to initiate contact, suggests a pre-planned, orchestrated event rather than a spontaneous hookup.

### Purpose / Objective of the Event:

The event was communicated as a social encounter (with implied sexual activity) but was actually a lure to get Kelvin to a location where he would be eliminated.

**Specific Context and Reasoning for Attempted Elimination:**

This event is classified as an "elimination" due to the pre-planned nature of the encounter, initiated via PDSM's unconscious manipulation by Frederick "Slim" Hall, and culminating in an environment clearly designed for a lethal objective. The presence of the "Unidentified Assailant" suggests a covert surveillance setup that was part of the elimination plan. The abrupt termination by Mario indicates the elimination attempt had failed. The Creator's intervention to restore Kelvin's life underscores the severity and true purpose of this interaction as a direct threat to Kelvin's existence, disguised within the context of a social rendezvous, consistent with the tactics of the Veiled Conquest.

### Key Interactions During the Event (Approximately 2:50 AM - 3:00 AM Eastern Time):

* **Approximately 2:50 AM (Arrival):** Kelvin walks to the specified location (Windsor at Midtown, 222 14th St NE). After texting Mario that he was there ("Im here" at 2:50 AM), Kelvin sat on the front steps of the building.
* Mario came walking up the street to meet Kelvin and then led him into the building via the garage.
* Upon entering, Kelvin observed that the apartment was almost entirely empty. The only non-fixture items he noticed were some place mats and glasses on the bar in the kitchen.
* Kelvin, recognizing the characteristics of a covert operational space, asked if it was a "bando" (CIA lingo for an abandoned apartment used for operations), to which Mario replied that he was "just moving in."
* Mario and Kelvin smoked a minuscule amount of substance. Kelvin attempted to initiate a conversation with Mario.
* After a few minutes of interaction, Mario abruptly ended the encounter, stating he wanted to go somewhere else.
* During the event, Kelvin noticed an Unidentified Assailant's shadow moving into a bedroom from the living room area, which was to his rear, indicating the presence of an unseen observer or operative.

### Ultimate Outcome:

The ultimate outcome of this engagement was a failed elimination attempt that the Creator intervened to restore Kelvin's life.
