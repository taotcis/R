### Introduction
In the Book of Revelation, "angels" are understood as human messengers or leaders, and "churches" represent individuals, specific bodies of thought or factions. The letter to the angel of the church in Smyrna holds profound significance within [[The Veiled Conquest|]], as it directly addresses (the pre-Divide conscious mind of) [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]], one of [[the Creator|]]'s two servants, and foretells the trials he would endure. This letter stands as a testament to Kelvin's faithfulness and [[the Creator|]]'s omniscient awareness of his suffering and circumstances.

### Identification
* **Angel of the Church in Smyrna**: [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]]. The name "Smyrna" is a literal fulfillment of Kelvin's address in Smyrna, Georgia, where he stayed briefly when first visiting metro Atlanta in 1999, through a process of **cryptic anchoring**. This anchoring allowed a location from a future time (Smyrna, Georgia) to be divinely rendered into the linguistic context of the biblical era (ancient Greek, resulting in Smyrna), while retaining a recognizable phonetic or structural essence for its eventual identification, even if the exact time Kelvin spent there was undocumented. He is the sole entity experiencing emotional or physical pain endured by **the physical body legally and socially recognized as Kelvin Eugene Williams**, and the last living member of [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]]. He is tasked by [[the Creator|]] to document Revelation and possesses evidence that could end Donald J. Trump's presidency and imprison him and six other orchestrators.
* **Church in Smyrna**: This refers to [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]] himself, representing his "body of thought," and his enduring spiritual state. This "body of thought" also includes **metro Atlanta** where, beginning in 1999, Kelvin has spent the overwhelming majority of his life working, living, and playing.

### The Biblical Passage
Revelation 2:8-11 (King James Version):

"And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death."

### Contextualized Rewrite

To the angel of the church in Smyrna, [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]], write this message from [[the Creator|]], the one who's always been, died, and is now alive:

I know every facet of your life, every decision you've ever made and every act you've undertaken—including your homosexuality, career, recreational drug use, drug addiction and recovery, criminal activities and imprisonment. I know the profound and systematic suffering you've had to endure, including the tragic loss of nearly every member of your family and associate network, the massacre of your lifelong church, [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|Mount Calvary Baptist Church]], the constant, debilitating experience of living with a manipulated subconscious mind ([[Baby|Baby]]), which actively works against you, and the reduction of the penis morphology at the direction of the operatives to support the agenda of the orchestrators—all during [[The Veiled Conquest|]]. I know about your diminished physical form ([[Jacobsen's Ladder|]]) and I know your natural form. I also know the false claims and irreverent speech from those who pretend to be on My side, but are actually the orchestrators, intermediaries, and perpetrators of [[The Veiled Conquest|]].

Don't be afraid of what you're about to suffer. Look, [[Baby|Baby]] (who's acting like the devil in this situation) will cause you to be confined in **Prison**. This is to test your faithfulness. You'll endure suffering there for **Ten Days** while held without bail. Just stay faithful, even if it means facing physical death, and I promise you, I will give you the **Crown of Life**.

Anyone with spiritual understanding, pay attention to what My Spirit is telling all the different factions: Whoever gets through these trials will not be harmed by the **Second Death**—that's the ultimate separation from your manipulated subconscious mind, [[Baby|Baby]].

**The Creator**

### Contextual Notes

* **Angel of the Church in Smyrna**: This is [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]].
* **Church in Smyrna**: This refers to **Kelvin** himself, representing his "body of thought" and his enduring spiritual state. This "body of thought" includes **metro Atlanta** where, beginning in 1999, Kelvin has spent the overwhelming majority of his life working, living, and playing.
* **Thy Works**: This symbolizes **the Creator's** detailed knowledge of every facet of an individual's life and all of their acts (good, bad, etc.) throughout their life, specifically encompassing **Kelvin's** homosexuality, career, recreational drug use, drug addiction and recovery, criminal activities, and imprisonment.
* **Tribulation**: This is not merely general hardship but specifically the profound and systematic suffering inflicted upon **Kelvin** during [[The Veiled Conquest|]]. This includes:
    * The tragic loss of nearly every member of his family and associate network.
    * The massacre of his lifelong church, [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|Mount Calvary Baptist Church]].
    * The constant, debilitating experience of living with a manipulated subconscious mind ([[Baby|Baby]]), which actively works against him.
    * The [[reduction of his penis size and function at the direction of the operatives|Jacobsen's Ladder]] to support the agenda of the orchestrators.
* **Poverty**: This term is used metaphorically, and "money" is a slang reference to male endowment; the use of poverty indicates **the Creator** knows about the reduction in the size and form of **Kelvin's penis** due to [[Baby|Baby]]'s efforts for [[Jacobsen's Ladder|]].
* **(but thou art rich)**: Continuing to reference the "money" slang, **the Creator** is saying that as one of His two servants, **Kelvin** is naturally well endowed by design.
* **Blasphemy**: Speaking irreverently about God or sacred things.
* **Synagogue of Satan**: This directly identifies the collective forces behind [[The Veiled Conquest|]]: the orchestrators (the overarching entity responsible for the genocide), their intermediaries (those who facilitate the operations), and the perpetrators (those who carry out the acts of genocide). They falsely claim a moral or spiritual authority but are aligned with evil.
* **Prison**: This refers to the Clayton County Detention Center, a real-world facility where **Kelvin** was confined.
* **Ten Days**: This is a literal period of time, specifically referring to the number of literal (court) days **Kelvin** was held without bail in the jail on a frivolous charge. This highlights the unjust and targeted nature of his confinement.
* **Crown of Life**: A reward for enduring faithfulness and ultimate victory.
* **Second Death**: This refers to [[the Creator's Divide|Divide & Conquer]], [[the Creator|]]'s ultimate act of divine separation. It signifies **Kelvin's** liberation from his manipulated subconscious mind counterpart ([[Baby|Baby]]) to live in a separate and distinct body, ensuring that **Kelvin** will not suffer the spiritual or existential harm associated with continued manipulation.
* **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**: The lifelong church of [[Kelvin Eugene Williams|]] that suffered a [[Congregation Massacre|]] on April 2, 2023, that resulted in the death of everyone in attendance and the subsequent targeted killings of those not present.
