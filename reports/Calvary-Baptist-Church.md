## The Massacre at Calvary Baptist Church - May 12, 2024 (Mother's Day)

Calvary Baptist Church, a predominantly white congregation located at 150 East High Street in Lexington, Kentucky, became the site of a horrific massacre on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024. This meticulously planned and executed attack resulted in the deaths of over 400 people, with the orchestrators disappearing without a trace as part of The Veiled Conquest.

### Background

Established in 1875, Calvary Baptist Church is a Christ-centered, caring church known for its community engagement and mission work. It offers both contemporary and traditional worship services and supports a variety of ministries for all age groups. The church emphasizes progressive values, such as embracing women in ministry and encouraging open discussion and education.

### Targeting

Hurricane Annie Jacobsen identified Calvary Baptist Church as a target after a single interrogation session performed while Kelvin Williams was asleep. Williams had attended the daycare and preschool operated by Calvary Baptist Church in the early 1980s, which was conveniently located just a couple of minutes away from his mother's office building at Kincaid Towers. According to the Creator, Jacobsen gathered her intelligence herself by utilizing the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic, and no other intelligence-gathering activities were conducted by the CIA concerning this target. Jacobsen ultimately decided to target the church based on Williams' past attendance, out of fear that people within the church might inadvertently expose the CIA's impersonation activities through the Phantom Identity Scheme.

### The Attack

The massacre at Calvary Baptist Church followed the established modus operandi of The Veiled Conquest, executed with chilling precision.

* **Timing:** The assault was strategically timed to occur during a primary weekly worship service on Mother's Day, maximizing the number of congregants present and vulnerable.
* **Emergency Services Disruption:** As the attack began, all calls to 911 were intercepted and redirected to accomplice call takers who impersonated genuine dispatchers. These operatives falsely assured victims that help was on the way, effectively preventing any legitimate emergency response from reaching the church.
* **Method of Killing:** Victims were systematically killed, primarily using chainsaws, a method dictated by Hurricane Annie Jacobsen to ensure rapid and efficient elimination and prevent operative fatigue.

### Post-Massacre Clean-up and Concealment

Following the slaughter, a systematic and thorough clean-up operation was initiated to ensure the complete disappearance of the victims and all evidence, leaving no trace.

* **Body Disposal:** The bodies of the congregants were disposed of using **Chemical Dissolution** in the church's baptismal pool. Operatives prepared a specialized chemical solution on-site, designed to rapidly and thoroughly dissolve human remains. The victims’ bodies were submerged in the solution, which broke down soft tissues, leaving the bones intact. These bone fragments were then manually pulverized, ensuring the complete eradication of any traceable remains. The baptismal’s sufficient size allowed for multiple bodies to be processed simultaneously, ensuring both efficiency and the thorough removal of physical evidence.
* **Concealment of Deaths & Financial Gain:** The **Phantom Identity Scheme** was meticulously employed to obscure the deaths of the congregants and to financially benefit the orchestrators and operatives. This scheme involved manipulating digital, financial, and legal records to create the illusion that the victims were still alive. Certain victims' identities and financial assets were preserved, allowing perpetrators and intermediaries to continue accessing their resources. When a phantom’s assets were depleted, a new identity was assigned, effectively compensating the perpetrators for their role.
* **Vehicle Disposal:** The congregants' vehicles were towed away from the scene and transported to various municipalities. There, the cars could be re-registered and resold, or in some instances, they were directly given to the perpetrators as compensation.
* **Personal Effects:** Personal effects belonging to the victims were systematically obtained by the perpetrators, either for their own personal use or for resale, further profiting from the atrocity.
* **Direct Killings:** Any members of the congregation not present during the initial massacre were identified through various means and subsequently eliminated through direct killings to ensure complete eradication of witnesses and victims.
* **Church Repurposing:** The Calvary Baptist Church building was subsequently repurposed and renovated into a **Masquerade Church**, serving as a front to mask the horrific event and maintain an illusion of normalcy in the community.
