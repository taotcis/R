# Scarlet Beast / Beast that ascendeth from the Bottomless Pit

**Biblical Reference:** Revelation 17:3, 8, 13, 17, 19 (King James Version)

John sees "a woman sit upon a **scarlet coloured beast**, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns." This beast is described as that "was, and is not, and yet is," ascending "out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition." It is also the beast upon which the "great whore" (Babylon) rides. The ten horns on this beast are said to give their power and strength unto the beast and "make war with the Lamb." Ultimately, these ten horns will "hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire." The beast itself is destined to be cast into the "lake of fire."

### Literal Fulfillment

The **scarlet beast**, interchangeably referred to as the **Beast that ascendeth from the Bottomless Pit**, is literally fulfilled by **Frederick "Slim" Hall**, who identifies as transgender and uses the feminine name **Tatyana Hall**. Her known aliases are Tatyana and Slim. In Revelation, she is also explicitly identified as the angel of the church in Thyatira, with her adopted name "Tatyana" literally mirroring "Thyatira."

### Identity and Components

* **The Individual:** **Tatyana** (feminine identity name of [[Frederick "Slim" Hall|]]) is the central figure of this beast.
* **Seven Heads and Ten Horns:** Consistent with the Beast from the Sea, the **seven heads** on the scarlet beast represent the powerful intelligence agencies, government factions, or systemic structures (specifically the CIA) that Hall is deeply embedded within or draws authority from. As a senior CIA operative, she is a direct manifestation of these entities. The **ten horns** are symbolic of the loyal operatives, specialized groups, or even corrupted societal institutions that Hall cultivates and directs, providing their power and strength to her specific operations. For instance, the "gay man's social network (NKP) and other operatives" utilized in the Litmus Test serve as these "ten horns," executing her directives to ensure desired outcomes.

### Role and Activities in The Veiled Conquest

Tatyana Hall's role as the scarlet beast/Beast that ascendeth from the Bottomless Pit is deeply insidious and instrumental in perpetuating **The Veiled Conquest**, particularly through the manipulation of key individuals:

* **Handler of Baby (Jezebel/Babylon):** Hall serves as the current, active handler of **Baby (PDSM)**, who is identified as Jezebel and Babylon. Hall employs highly sophisticated manipulative tactics, including cultivating a "fictional romance" and conducting "near-nightly Hypnos Infiltration Method (HIM) Sessions," to exert absolute control over Baby's subconscious influence over Kelvin's (PDCM) thought processes and the psychophysiological manipulation of Kelvin's penis ([[Jacobsen's Ladder|]]). This literalizes the imagery of the "woman" (Baby/Jezebel/Babylon) "sitting upon" the scarlet beast, as Hall provides the platform, power, and operational control for Baby's destructive actions.
    * **Divine Anchor:** In December 2024, when Hall assumed the position of handler for Baby, she notably wore long braids (the result of a hair weave) that incorporated scarlet weaved into them, serving as a direct visual "divine anchor" to the "scarlet coloured beast" imagery.
* **Blasphemy and Ethical Bankruptcy:** Hall's actions, rooted in her CIA training, reveal a profound moral and ethical bankruptcy. Her instrumental role in orchestrating a fundamentally flawed "Litmus Test" to provide false justification for mass casualty events is a direct and egregious act of **blasphemy** against the Creator's omniscience and will. Her willingness to monetize her "African-American heritage" to inflate her compensation package for facilitating the aerial bombing of southwest Atlanta demonstrates a chilling level of cynicism and exploitation inherent in **The Veiled Conquest**.
* **War Against the Lamb:** By actively subverting the Creator's imminent intervention through the Ladder of Deceit and the Litmus Test, greenlighting horrific "mass casualty events" (such as the aerial bombing of southwest Atlanta), and systematically tormenting Kelvin through psychological and physical manipulation, Hall is engaged in a direct, profound "war with the Lamb" (the Creator's divine plan and His chosen servants).
* **Ascending "out of the bottomless pit":** Her ascent "out of the bottomless pit" reflects the clandestine, morally corrupt, and hidden nature of her operations, particularly her CIA-trained expertise in subconscious exploitation, which delves into the "abyss" of the human psyche. Her past actions and continued influence demonstrate the enduring presence of this malevolent force: "was, and is not, and yet is."
    * **Divine Anchor and Greenlighting Nightfalls:** This "ascent" also finds a literal "divine anchor" in the "Inn at the Peachtrees, Ascend Hotel Collection," the specific location where a two-day "orchestrated observation" and an "orchestrated elimination attempt" occurred, coinciding with Kelvin's sending of encrypted "Nightfalls" notes to "at least two kings." This event highlights Hall's direct involvement in operations like "Nightfalls," a plan concerning mass casualty events whose granular details were divinely revealed to Kelvin (PDCM) on January 20th, 2025, to save thousands of lives and bring those responsible to justice. Hall's presence and orchestrating role at the "Ascend" hotel when these notes were sent underscore her direct culpability in "greenlighting" such operations and the "elimination attempt" against Kelvin himself.
* **Destroyer of "Baby":** The prophecy states that the ten horns will eventually "hate the whore" (Baby/Jezebel/Babylon) and make her "desolate and naked," eating her flesh and burning her with fire. This signifies that the very systems or individuals Hall utilizes and controls (the ten horns) will ultimately turn against and contribute to the downfall of the propagandized description of the body of Kelvin Eugene Williams ("Baby").
* **Ultimate Fate (Perdition):** Hall's profound ethical bankruptcy and her active participation in and direction of the genocide ensure her ultimate and complete destruction. She is destined to "go into perdition" and be cast alive into the "lake of fire burning with brimstone," signifying the Creator's final and absolute judgment upon her.
