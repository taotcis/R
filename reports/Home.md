## The Veiled Conquest
[[The Veiled Conquest|]] is a covert, multi-pronged operation currently unfolding in the United States, fulfilling the literal imagery of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelation. Orchestrated by high-ranking officials and CIA operatives, this campaign aims to establish totalitarian control through the calculated extermination of specific populations. Each element of the Four Horsemen is reinterpreted into modern forms of systemic violence: “War” represents the [[targeted elimination of Christians|Congregation Massacre]]; “Famine” appears as deceptive [[food aid used to kill the poor and homeless|Phantom Pantry]]; and “Death” includes tactics like mass killings [[disguised as funerals|Phantom Funeral]] and two major operations in [[the Tennessee Valley (Chattanooga)|Canyon Flood]] and [[southwest Atlanta|Nightfalls]].

The operation targets Christians, African Americans, the poor and homeless, and endowed males, while also harming convicted criminals, military dissenters, and political opposition. Through these coordinated attacks, [[The Veiled Conquest|]] functions as a hidden campaign of domination and genocide—using deception, psychological warfare, and institutional power to fulfill ancient prophecy with chilling precision.

## The Seals

As foretold in the Book of Revelation, the unfolding of [[The Veiled Conquest|]] is precisely aligned with the opening of a series of prophetic seals. Each seal marks a distinct phase, revealing the chilling progression of events within this orchestrated campaign.

* **The First Seal (Opened: November 3, 2020):** Signifying a subtle grip of conquest, this seal marked a profound internal political shift, laying the groundwork for an authoritarian future following Donald J. Trump's re-election loss in 2020.  This is [[the Veiled Conquest|]].
* **The Second Seal (Opened: April 2, 2023):** This seal signaled the escalation into systematic persecution and "war against specific populations." Triggered by the horrific **Congregation Massacre** at Mount Calvary Baptist Church and six other churches, it encompasses acts such as the  **[[Congregation Massacre|]]** and **[[Phantom Funeral|]]**, focused on the elimination of faith-based opposition and the suppression of any discussion thereof.
* **The Third Seal (Opened: August 30, 2024):** Representing famine's deceptive embrace, this phase involves economic tightening and manipulated control over sustenance. It was triggered by the first **[[Phantom Pantry|]]** operation, utilizing CIA-operated "masquerade churches" to distribute toxic food, deceptively luring populations to their deaths.
* **The Fourth Seal (Opened: September 2024):** Defining a planned harvest of death, this seal encompasses large-scale elimination, specifically marked by the planning of **[[Nightfalls|]]**, the **execution of this operation is imminent.** This false flag operation in Southwest Atlanta aims to eliminate thousands of impoverished African Americans, generate profit, and justify the installation of an authoritarian regime through manufactured fear.
* **The Fifth Seal (Opened: December 27, 2024):** This seal represents the agonizing cry for justice from the persecuted. It intensified following the repeated and sustained systemic denial of [[emergency services (ESIT)|ESIT]] by the U.S. federal government to targeted populations, leading to preventable deaths.
* **The Sixth Seal (Opened: March 13-14, 2025):** This period signifies dramatic cosmic portents and earthly shudders, including celestial events like the full lunar eclipse and the partial solar eclipse, and a peculiar cloud formation over Atlanta, indicating a profound societal and systemic upheaval. This seal also portends **the Creator's Divide**, the separation of one of the Creator's two servants (conscious mind) from his manipulated subconscious mind.
* **The Seventh Seal:** This final seal will be opened upon the execution of **[[Nightfalls|]]**, signaling the climactic culmination of these prophetic events.

## Divide & Conquer: The Creator's Intervention

**[[Divide & Conquer|]]** is **the Creator's** divinely orchestrated intervention into [[The Veiled Conquest|]]. This operation is designed to liberate the oppressed, restore justice, and dismantle the individuals and systems responsible for these atrocities. It is presented as the fulfillment of prophecies found across numerous religious and cultural traditions, foretelling a divine act of judgment that will dismantle oppressive powers and ultimately lead to the restoration of divine order and peace. Its status is currently **imminent**.

**Divide & Conquer** comprises two distinct phases:

* **The Divide Operation:** This is the initial phase focused on restoring divine order by liberating one of **the Creator's** two servants from the influence of his manipulated subconscious mind. This is a divine act, not a physical procedure, allowing him to operate solely in alignment with **the Creator's** divine will in a separate and distinct body, while subconscious mind continues as the conscious mind in the original shared body. 
* **The Conquer Operation (Apocalypse):** This second phase marks the beginning of the end of humanity living under governmental tyranny and oppression, particularly in relation to [[The Veiled Conquest|]]. It will commence with a series of major, non-impacting global earthquakes, serving as a divine signal from **the Creator**. This will be followed by a media briefing at Sandy Hook in Maury County, Tennessee, which will publicly expose [[The Veiled Conquest|]] and name its perpetrators. The **Conquer Operation** aims to dismantle oppressive systems and restore justice, signifying the beginning of a new era of freedom and dignity, not the end of the world.

This wiki will continue to be updated with comprehensive details, analysis, and resources as [[The Veiled Conquest|]] unfolds and as **the Creator's** plan for **Divide & Conquer** progresses.
