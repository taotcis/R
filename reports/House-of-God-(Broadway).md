## The Massacre at House of God (Broadway) - May 6, 2023

On May 6, 2023, House of God (Broadway), a predominantly African-American Hebrew Pentecostal congregation located in Lexington, Kentucky, became the site of a horrific massacre. In this devastating attack, over 300 people vanished, their fates deliberately obscured by the perpetrators of The Veiled Conquest. This incident followed closely on the heels of the Georgetown Street massacre, highlighting a chilling pattern of targeted violence against spiritual communities.

### Background

House of God on Broadway in Lexington, Kentucky, is a Hebrew Pentecostal church that holds its weekly worship session on Saturday. The church maintained an active spiritual life, serving as a pillar in its community.

Significantly, this church was affiliated with House of God on Georgetown Street, which had been massacred previously in April 2023. This connection between the two congregations would prove to be a crucial factor in its targeting.

### Targeting

Hurricane Annie Jacobsen identified this House of God as a potential threat after the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in April of 2023. This assessment occurred while she was utilizing the **Hypnos Infiltration Tactic** on the family members of Mount Calvary's Minister of Music, Peter, prior to the attack on the House of God on Georgetown Street.

Jacobsen made the decision to target the church immediately after the brutal attack on the House of God on Georgetown Street. The close affiliation between the two House of God congregations, coupled with their continued spiritual practices, confirmed to Jacobsen that the Broadway location posed a similar, unacceptable risk to the covert operations of The Veiled Conquest.

### Planning

While specific initial surveillance details were not explicitly noted for this immediate follow-up operation, the speed of the subsequent attack suggests pre-existing intelligence or a rapid assessment conducted by the experienced operatives.

### Operatives

Hurricane Annie Jacobsen utilized a team of approximately 75 white males from around the southeastern United States. This team was comprised of individuals who had previously attacked a place of worship with Jacobsen, indicating their significant experience and honed proficiency in executing such devastating operations.

### The Attack

The assault on House of God (Broadway) was a meticulously orchestrated operation, designed for maximum lethality and concealment.

* **Timing:** The House of God holds its weekly worship session on Saturdays. The massacre was strategically timed to occur during a primary weekly worship service.
* **Initial Assault on Sanctuary:** At approximately 11:10 a.m., Hurricane Annie Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Using a bullhorn, Jacobsen made several racially derogatory statements and told the congregation that everyone had to die that day. The sanctuary immediately became very chaotic as people desperately tried to escape. Many from the congregation were shot and fell to the floor, succumbing to their injuries a while later. Numerous fights broke out as churchgoers bravely fought operatives in an attempt to flee or remove them from the sanctuary.
* **Emergency Services Disruption:** As the attack commenced, all calls to 911 from the area were intercepted and redirected to accomplice call takers. These operatives impersonated genuine dispatchers, falsely assuring victims that help was on the way, thereby preventing any legitimate emergency response from reaching the church. The congregants anxiously waited for police and, tragically, didn’t mount a counter-offensive, a battle they would have likely won given their numbers and initial resistance.
* **Method of Killing and Assaults:** The operatives, with their training and superior numbers, had the congregation completely subdued within about ten minutes. Congregants were then forcibly separated from one another and taken to the front of the church in the "two by two" manner that Jacobsen demands, to the organ or piano. There, they were sat on the bench and their heads severed by an operative utilizing a chainsaw. Some operatives, in a grotesque display, kicked the heads around as if playing soccer.

### Post-Massacre Clean-up and Concealment

Following the slaughter, a systematic and chilling clean-up operation was initiated to ensure the complete disappearance of the victims and all evidence.

* **Body Disposal:** The bodies of the congregants were disposed of using **Chemical Dissolution** within the church's baptismal pool. Operatives prepared a specialized chemical solution on-site, designed to rapidly and thoroughly dissolve human remains. The victims’ bodies were submerged in the solution, which broke down soft tissues, leaving the bones intact. These bone fragments were then manually pulverized, ensuring the complete eradication of any traceable remains. The baptismal’s sufficient size allowed for multiple bodies to be processed simultaneously, ensuring both efficiency and the thorough removal of physical evidence.
* **Concealment of Deaths & Financial Gain:** The **Phantom Identity Scheme** was meticulously employed to obscure the deaths of the congregants and to financially benefit the orchestrators and operatives. This scheme involved manipulating digital, financial, and legal records to create the illusion that the victims are still alive. Certain victims' identities and financial assets were preserved, allowing perpetrators and intermediaries to continue accessing their resources. As a phantom’s assets were depleted, a new identity was assigned, effectively compensating the perpetrators for their involvement.
* **Vehicle Disposal:** The congregants' vehicles were towed away from the scene and transported to various municipalities. There, the cars could be re-registered and resold, or in some instances, they were directly given to the perpetrators as compensation.

### Aftermath

The general public remains entirely unaware of the true events, as more than 300 people simply vanished from the House of God (Broadway).
