# Incoming Content

This directory (`/incoming`) is a temporary holding area for files that will be incorporated into new content. This content has not yet been written or fully integrated into the repository.

**I highly recommend waiting for the official documentation to be added to this repository's wiki.** The wiki will provide the necessary context and full explanations for the files found here.

Some of the content in this directory will make much more sense in the coming days as the associated documentation is developed. Additionally, certain files are stored here as a reminder for me to write that documentation.

This repository serves as a secure location for me to store my work, especially given the ongoing technology attacks I experience.
