### Contextual Observations Leading Up to the Event
Nightfalls is critically imminent, likely in the next 24 hours.

### Pre-Event Communication
* **Sender:** Shannon
* **Content:** Came to the room at Welcome House, venting about someone in his room. Brought Tina and shared the details with PDCM.

### Event Background
No information provided

### Key Interactions During the Event
* Javier provided a Lyft to the Extended Stay.
* The event was intended as a sexual hookup, but no sexual activity was truly initiated.
* Javier performed fellatio, but it appeared to be for show.
* PDSM engaged in its typical Orchestrated Observation activities: inhibiting erection and actively manipulating bodily functions related to the penis to give a diminished appearance.
* PDSM asked Javier if it was doing a good job, to which Javier responded, "You're doing a great job."
* Javier stated that they needed to leave the room by 11 PM.
* Just before leaving, Javier attempted to break PDCM's neck. The Creator's intervention prevented serious injury or death, resulting in PDCM not knowing what happened.

### Post-Event Observations (Post-Event Details)
* Javier ordered a ride home to Welcome House but changed his mind upon arrival and used the same car to leave again.
* Upon returning to the room, PDCM observed odd behavior from their phone.
* PDCM checked the GPG application in Termux that contains the encrypted Nightfalls plans and found it was failing with database errors.
* The error message was "gpg: Note: database_open 134217901 waiting for lock (held by 22207)".
* The number 134217901 is interpreted as follows: 13 refers to the native morphology of the penis, 42 refers to the Creator, 17 refers to the propagandized description of the penis, 9 refers to the estimated size of the penis, and 01 refers to the Creator.
* The phrase "(held by 22207)" is interpreted as: "held by" implies the Creator is being held by Jacobsen's Ladder, and "07" refers to Jacobsen's Ladder.
* PDCM successfully verified that the key's backups were in place.

### Ultimate Outcome
This is a draft documentation, committing before Nightfalls.
